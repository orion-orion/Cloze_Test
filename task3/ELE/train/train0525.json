{"article": "Last year, for a nationwide teacher conference, I was asked to make a presentation about my classroom. I immediately _ to offer to the conference photo collections and mementos that would prove how meaningful teachers' work was in the world of classroom. So, for weeks, I looked _ the drawers, boxes, and cupboard, hoping to find just the right prints that would tell of the spirit of my school and my community. All through September, I sought photos of lessons activties and accounts I had put away _ in my house. I asked my colleagues to help me find images or objects that would _ our most famous community members. By mid-October, I had made a list of them. But, I had also found something _ , something much more dear, and very rare. I found photos of Craig, a high school senior, who gave up two weeks one summer to help little kids draw pictures at a camp. I found notes from Calvin whom I had taught for almost six years, and remembered how he always made sure every classmate felt accepted. I found a resume written by Carrie who _ herself without the help of parents, and who took night class, and never _ one. I found a copy of Macbeth in Portuguese, which belonged to an exchange student who read it first in her own _ , before reading it in ours. Thus she could be sure she wasn't missing anything important in the _ . I found all my students, the students who had made me laugh, the students who had _ me with their courage and kindness, the students who had _ me to question what I knew of the world outside my own world, the students who had inspired me to expect more from them and from myself. There I was, standing at my filing cupboard reviewing _ --not those I had taught, but the many I had learned. I came to teaching, as most teachers do, hoping to touch the hearts and minds of my students. What I never expected was how _ they would touch mine. Today I walk through the door of my classroom ready to teach, but also _ to learn from the young people who are excited to teach me about them --their insights and interests, problems and anxieties, hopes and expectations.", "options": [["decided", "managed", "preferred", "remembered"], ["at", "over", "for", "through"], ["anywhere", "everywhere", "somewhere", "nowhere"], ["recognize", "represent", "regard", "replace"], ["unknown", "familiar", "unexpected", "funny"], ["abandoned", "enjoyed", "relaxed", "supported"], ["changed", "missed", "took", "forgot"], ["language", "way", "voice", "mind"], ["translation", "paper", "expression", "copy"], ["trusted", "filled", "provided", "moved"], ["ordered", "consulted", "recommended", "challenged"], ["documents", "lessons", "essays", "classes"], ["carefully", "seriously", "powerfully", "slightly"], ["nervous", "eager", "confident", "lucky"]], "answers": ["A", "D", "C", "B", "C", "D", "B", "A", "A", "D", "D", "B", "C", "B"]}
