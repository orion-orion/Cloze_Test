{"article": "Earlier this morning I e-mailed an old friend, Mark. We have been out of touch for 12- years, but the _ is a wonderful thing. Finding his e-mail address _ less than a minute. He is working on his doctoral paper in western America. Mark and I met at a summer _ that we both attended. I went every year from the time I was 8- or 9- until I was 15.
