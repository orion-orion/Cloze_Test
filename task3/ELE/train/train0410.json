{"article": "One day I met a man in the hospital, who needed blood to save his daughter. He was struggling to get blood for her and curiously _ my blood type. My blood type was the same needed for his daughter. Before that I _ donated my blood, so I was afraid of doing this and didn't know what to do. Then suddenly I saw a little girl in the hospital, who was _ from a critical disease and needed blood from her six-year-old brother. Yes, from her younger brother, why? His brother had _ suffered with the same disease and by God's kindness _ by developing the anti-bodies needed to fight for the disease. The doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and asked the boy if he would be _ to give his blood to his sister. I saw him _ for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying, \"Yes, I'll do it if it will save my sister.\" As the transfusion progressed, he smiled, seeing the _ returning to her sister's cheeks. But suddenly, his face grew pale and his _ faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a _ voice, \"Am I going to die?\" Being young, the boy had _ the doctor; he thought he was going to give her all his blood and _ his life. I felt _ , when that young boy, _ the fact of blood donation, got ready to give his blood, thinking that he will lose his life but save his sister's life. And I, being a mature person, knowing that this will not _ my life, I will not lose my life, _ save others' lives and I was hesitant of doing this. That moment _ my thoughts and I became enthusiastic about doing this important duty and felt that true _ by helping save that little girl's life. If any patient dies due to a blood shortage, I will not call this the _ of doctors, as science is still not able to make blood artificially. Only we can save others' lives _ donating blood.", "options": [["tested", "asked", "noticed", "found"], ["always", "ever", "seldom", "never"], ["suffering", "dropping", "preventing", "recovering"], ["almost", "only", "still", "also"], ["survived", "died", "corrected", "controlled"], ["careful", "willing", "fearful", "hard"], ["shake", "defend", "hesitate", "bargain"], ["sorrow", "relief", "color", "pain"], ["plan", "smile", "light", "pride"], ["disappointing", "exciting", "trembling", "satisfying"], ["questioned", "misunderstood", "accepted", "believed"], ["lose", "protect", "save", "destroy"], ["ashamed", "proud", "scared", "pleased"], ["discovering", "designing", "unknowing", "collecting"], ["improve", "select", "turn", "affect"], ["so", "and", "or", "but"], ["threw", "changed", "hurt", "stopped"], ["happiness", "success", "purpose", "advantage"], ["goal", "task", "fault", "nature"], ["to", "for", "on", "by"]], "answers": ["B", "D", "A", "D", "A", "B", "C", "C", "B", "C", "B", "A", "A", "C", "D", "D", "B", "A", "C", "D"]}
