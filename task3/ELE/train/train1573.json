{"article": "In 1972, I returned to Miami Beach High School to speak to the drama class. Afterward I asked the drama teacher _ any of my English teachers are still there. Irene Roberts, he tells me, is in the class _ down the hall. I was no one special in Miss Roberts' class -- just another student who did okay work. I don't recall any one special bit of wisdom she passed on. Yet I cannot forget her _ for language, for ideas and for her students. I _ now, many years later, that she is the perfect example of a _ teacher. I'd like to say something to her, I say, but I don't want to _ her from a class. Nonsense, he says, she'll be _ to see you. The drama teacher _ Miss Roberts into the hallway where stands this 32-year-old man she last saw at 18. \"I'm Mark Medoff,\" I tell her. \"You were my 12th-grade English teacher in 1958.\" She _ her head to one side and looks at me, as if this angle might remember me in her _ . And then, though armed with a message I want to _ in many words, I can't think up anything more memorable than this: \"I want you to know,\" I say, \"you were _ to me.\" And there in the hallway, this lovely woman, now nearing _ age, this teacher who doesn't remember me, begins to weep; and she encircles me in her arms. _ this moment, I begin to sense that everything I will ever know, everything I will ever pass to my students, is an inseparable part of a legacy of our ancestors. Irene Roberts holds me _ in her arms and through her tears whispers _ my cheek, \"Thank you.\" And then, with the briefest of looks into my forgotten face, she _ back into her classroom, _ to what she has done thousands of days through all the years of my _ . On reflection, maybe those were, after all , just the right words to say to Irene Roberts. Maybe they are the very words I would like to speak to all those teachers through my life, the very words I would like spoken to me one day by some returning student: \"I want you to know you were important to me.\"", "options": [["that", "if", "as", "when"], ["just", "almost", "nearly", "about"], ["kindness", "respect", "friendship", "love"], ["know", "learn", "realize", "believe"], ["selfish", "self-confident", "self-conscious", "selfless"], ["call", "drag", "push", "pull"], ["upset", "delighted", "interested", "annoyed"], ["brings", "takes", "fetches", "introduces"], ["bows", "raises", "rises", "puts"], ["thought", "brain", "attention", "memory"], ["announce", "speak", "deliver", "tell"], ["useful", "important", "hopeful", "beneficial"], ["retirement", "enjoyment", "employment", "happiness"], ["Reminding", "Explaining", "Remembering", "Forgetting"], ["happily", "straight", "calmly", "briefly"], ["against", "with", "off", "beyond"], ["escapes", "gathers", "disappears", "fails"], ["longs", "continues", "goes", "returns"], ["absence", "class", "work", "task"]], "answers": ["B", "A", "B", "C", "D", "D", "B", "A", "B", "D", "C", "B", "A", "C", "D", "A", "C", "D", "A"]}
