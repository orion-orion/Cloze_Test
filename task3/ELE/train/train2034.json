Instead of 42 _ of her hard life, she accepted her fate and 43 _ the ordinary into the extraordinary. No matter how serious things seemed to be, she found a(n) 44 _ side and a ray of hope. She taught her family the 45 _ of hard work and the importance of education, 46 _ she only went as far as fourth grade. Her children didn't have material 47 _ , but they certainly received the necessary and 48 _ things in life: love, spiritual guidance, concern for others, appreciation for a table filled with food,and 49 _ for the law.
