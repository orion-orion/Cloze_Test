I didn't need to know a word of Chinese to understand there were _ beds available for the Thursday night train from Beijing to Shanghai. I had a Friday morning _ with my college friend. I must be on that train. Desperate times call for desperate measures. So I squatted . I assumed that this was the international _ for \"Are there any hard seats available?\" _ , there were. It was seat 109. Very quickly, I found it. The Chinese man sitting in it, however, seemed to beg to differ. I panicked.

The man next to me drank a Coca-Cola, a bag of milk and a bottle of water and _ the course of 13 hours he did not move once. I drank _ but finally, I made my way to the bathroom at 3:02 am. After waiting in a thick cloud of cigarette smoke, I finally used the bathroom.
