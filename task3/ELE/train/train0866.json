{"article": "For many people today, reading is no longer relaxation. To keep up their work they must read letters, reports, trade publications, not to mention newspapers and magazines: a never-ending flood of words. In _ a job, the ability to read and understand _ can mean the difference between success and failure. Yet the unfortunate fact is that most of us are _ readers. Most of us _ bad reading habits at an early age, and never get over them. The main reason _ in the fact that words have little meaning _ they are put together into phrases, sentences and paragraphs. _ , however, the untrained reader does not read groups of words. He reads one word at a time and often goes back to _ words or passages. The tendency to look back over _ you have just read is a common bad habit in reading. Another habit which _ down the speed of reading is sounding each word as one reads. To overcome these bad habits, some reading clinics use a machine called an accelerator , which moves a bar _ the page at a predetermined speed. The bar is set at a slightly faster rate _ the reader finds comfortable, in order to train him. The accelerator forces the reader to read fast, _ word-by-word reading impossible. At first it is difficult to understand. But _ you have learned to read ideas and concepts, you will not only read faster, _ your comprehension will improve. Many people have found their reading skill quickly _ after some training. _ Charlce Au, a business manager, for example, his reading rate was 172 words a minute _ the training and now it is an excellent 1,378 words a minute. He is happy that now he can get through a lot more reading materials in a short period of time.", "options": [["applying", "getting", "offering", "supplying"], ["easily", "quickly", "roughly", "decidedly"], ["good", "curious", "common", "poor"], ["developed", "kicked", "knew", "understood"], ["touches", "connects", "lies", "gets"], ["unless", "after", "since", "as"], ["Unfortunately", "Excitedly", "Surprisingly", "Generally"], ["reuse", "rewrite", "reread", "recite"], ["which", "what", "that", "if"], ["breaks", "cuts", "goes", "slows"], ["inside", "up", "out", "down"], ["then", "as", "than", "beyond"], ["moving", "making", "leading", "thinking"], ["when", "where", "what", "which"], ["or", "nor", "but", "for"], ["lost", "weakened", "sharpened", "improved"], ["Take", "Look", "Make", "Consider"], ["for", "before", "after", "in"]], "answers": ["B", "B", "D", "A", "C", "A", "A", "C", "B", "D", "D", "C", "B", "A", "C", "D", "A", "B"]}
