{"article": "Today the scientific community is in almost total agreement that the earth's climate is changing and that this represents a huge threat to the planet and to us. According to a survey, with only 69% accepting the earth is warming-- only 1 in 4 Americans see global warming as a major threat, public opinion falls behind the scientific conclusion. Climate scientists and campaigners have long debated how to better communicate the message to nonexperts so that climate science can be _ into action. According to Christopher Rapley, the usual tactic of climate experts to provide the public with information isn't _ because \"it does not address key potential causes.\" We are all exposed to the evidence of climate change on an almost a daily basis. The information is almost _ . Then what's wrong? _ our brains. Daniel Gilbert mentioned our brains' failure to accurately notice gradual change. Robert Gifford also picks up on the point about our brains' difficulty in grasping climate change because of limited cognition and social _ with other people (\"Why should we change if X won't?\") \" A more powerful barrier is the _ of perceived behavioral control; 'I' m only one person; what can I do ?' is certainly a big one. For many, the first challenge will be in recognizing barriers _ they can overcome them\" But for those of us who understand that climate change is a problem yet make little effort to cut the number of overseas trips we make or the amount of meat we consume, neither the uncaring attitude nor denial really explains the _ between our actions and beliefs. Lertzman has come to the conclusion that the conflict between caring about both the planet and our way of life is too painful to bear. \"When we don't _ the pain of that, that's when we get _ and can't move forward.\" Lertzman refers to this _ as \"environmental melancholia ,\" and points out that there's a lot to be said for providing a means _ acceptable to talk about.\" Rosemary Randall suggests that climate change is such a(n) _ subject that it \"can raise fears and anxieties that people feel have no _ in polite conversation.\" Lertzman says the community has been slow to realize the value of psychology. Gifford says otherwise, _ --\" climate change, and not mental health, is the biggest psychological problem\" Despite the pain, shame, difficulty in fully addressing climate change, both Lertzman and Gifford are still _ about our ability to face up to the challenge. \"There can't be anything about the human mind that stops us struggling with these issues , given that so many people _ are -- maybe that's what we should be focusing on instead.\" says Lertzman.", "options": [["translated", "sprung", "forced", "sent"], ["revolutionary", "detailed", "popular", "enough"], ["unreliable", "unbearable", "unacceptable", "unavoidable"], ["Submit", "Control", "Blame", "Curse"], ["connections", "comparisons", "competence", "development"], ["sense", "problem", "lack", "effect"], ["if", "though", "before", "since"], ["relationship", "disagreement", "gap", "balance"], ["feel", "process", "remember", "hide"], ["hit", "puzzled", "stuck", "stressed"], ["conflict", "event", "hesitation", "inability"], ["socially", "environmentally", "culturally", "morally"], ["complex", "controversial", "awkward", "disturbing"], ["idea", "goal", "place", "choice"], ["somehow", "however", "therefore", "either"], ["optimistic", "concerned", "cheerful", "encouraged"], ["equally", "still", "especially", "already"]], "answers": ["A", "D", "D", "C", "B", "C", "C", "B", "B", "C", "D", "A", "D", "C", "B", "A", "D"]}
