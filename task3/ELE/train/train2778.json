{"article": "Some years ago, Houston airport faced a troubling customer-relations issue. Passengers were making a huge number of _ about the long waits at baggage claim . In response, the airport managers _ the number of baggage handlers. The plan worked: the average wait fell to eight minutes. But the complaints _ despite the apparent success.  _ , the managers undertook a more careful, on-site analysis. They found that it took passengers a minute to walk from their _ gates to baggage claim and seven more minutes to get their bags. Roughly 88 percent of their time, in other words, was spent standing around _ waiting for their bags. So the airport decided on a new approach: instead of reducing wait time, it _ the arrival gates farther away from baggage claim area. Passengers now had to _ six times longer to get their bags. Complaints dropped to near zero. This story shows a general _ : the experience of waiting is defined only partly by the actual length of the wait. Often the psychology of queuing is more _ than the length of the wait itself. Occupied time (walking to baggage claim) feels shorter than unoccupied time (standing at baggage claim). Research on _ has shown that, on average, people overestimate how long they've waited in a line by about 36 percent. This is also why one finds mirrors next to lifts. The spread of high-rise buildings after World War II led to complaints about lift _ . The motive behind the mirrors was _ to the one used at the Houston airport: give people something to _ their time, and the wait seems shorter.", "options": [["suggestions", "questions", "complaints", "challenges"], ["evaluated", "counted", "decreased", "increased"], ["continued", "disappeared", "doubled", "changed"], ["Annoyed", "Puzzled", "Discouraged", "Excited"], ["exit", "landing", "arrival", "departure"], ["uncomfortably", "aimlessly", "hopelessly", "impatiently"], ["freed", "sent", "moved", "removed"], ["wait", "walk", "waste", "sit"], ["principle", "approach", "belief", "reason"], ["scientific", "interesting", "useful", "important"], ["figures", "baggage", "queuing", "standing"], ["delays", "quality", "safety", "repairs"], ["devoted", "superior", "familiar", "similar"], ["take", "occupy", "use", "value"]], "answers": ["C", "D", "A", "B", "C", "D", "C", "B", "A", "D", "C", "A", "D", "B"]}
