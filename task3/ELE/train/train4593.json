I realized life is just too _ and it was time for me to make some changes -- do the things in life that I wanted to do without making _ why I couldn't do them. My dad _ a bone marrow transplant operation, and after that he was able to reuse his own \"cleaned\" marrow, so a donor was not needed. That was excellent _ because donors who are a match are hard to come by. That _ me to become a bone marrow donor and hopefully help someone else one day. I also _ money for the cancer patients. Yet, I was not satisfied with just that. I had to do more, I _ blood every other month and seek opportunities to do other acts of kindness daily. The opportunity, some days, presents itself very _ and some days I have to seek it out. Either way, it comes.
