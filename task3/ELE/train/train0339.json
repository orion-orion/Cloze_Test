{"article": "It would be my first Thanksgiving since my father moved to heaven, and it would also be my first Thanksgiving being away from my family. Holidays are _ when you can't be with family, and I was mourning the _ of my dad and feeling sad about being _ from my family in Indiana. But, that sadness turned into _ when it hit me: I was going to have to prepare a traditional Thanksgiving _ myself! That night at Dubya's Restaurant, which was our favorite place to _ , I began discussing the dilemma with Jeff.\"It's too bad that this place won't be _ on Thanksgiving, or we could just come here,\"I said. Dubya, the owner of the restaurant, happened to be _ by our table when I said those words.\"You mean you expect me to _ for you on Thanksgiving, too?\"he teased \" Well, I guess you'll just have to come to our _ since the restaurant will be closed then.\". We'd become _ with Dubya and his wife, as we ate at Dubya's twice a week; however, I didn't think we were close enough to _ Thanksgiving dinner with his family. I was sure he was _ . But as we headed toward the door, Dubya handed Jeff a note with directions to their house and their phone number. \"You're _ ?\" I asked \"Of course,\" he said. And, two days later, we reached Dubya's house. Everyone _ us. As expected, the food was marvelous but the company was even better. We truly felt that we _ there. Of course, I wrote them a thank-you note the next week, but I couldn't really _ into words what that Thanksgiving dinner _ had meant to us. I've never forgotten their kindness and that very _ Thanksgiving. So, here's my suggestion to you this year.
