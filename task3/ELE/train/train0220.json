His clothes were worn and it looked like he had gone in and got himself something _ to drink since it was cold outside. He must have not had enough money to get something to _ . That is not something I _ very well, because that is not what \" _ \"me.   Then a dog walked up. Being a dog lover, I could tell she had been _ puppies . She was terribly in need of something to eat and I felt so _ for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her puppies would not _ it.   My wife and I sat there and looked at her. We noticed that people walked by and didn't even pet _ . She might not have been as pretty and clean as most, but she still _ better. We still did not do anything. But someone did.
