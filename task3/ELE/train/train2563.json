{"article": "One evening, long after most people had gone to bed, a friend of mine and I went happily home through the _ street. We had been to a music-hall and were talking about the people we had seen and heard in it. \"The show _ him a star overnight, \" said my friend about one of them. \"He was completely _ before. And now thousands of people _ him gifts and letters. \" \"I thought him quite good, \" I said , \" but not _ thousands of letters . As a matter of fact , one of his songs gave me a shock. It was too noisy. \" \"What was that?\" my friend asked me, \" _ it to me .\" I began to sing. \"Do be quiet. You will give everybody a shock and _ them up for miles _ , besides, there will be a policeman in front of us. \" My friend gave me a surprised look. \"Never mind. I don't care. What is the matter?\" I said and went on singing _ the top of my voice . Suddenly there came a policeman, _ in front of me , his notebook _ . \" Excuse me , sir ,\" he said , \"You have a very good voice , if I _ say so . Who taught you singing? I'd very much _ to find someone who can give my daughter singing lessons. Would you be kind enough to tell me your name and address? Then my wife and I would visit you and we could discuss it .\"", "options": [["calm", "crowded", "silence", "quiet"], ["called", "turned", "named", "made"], ["famous", "forgotten", "stranger", "unknown"], ["show", "write", "send", "brought"], ["worthy", "worth", "received", "accepted"], ["Read", "Sing", "Say", "Tell"], ["call", "pick", "wake", "join"], ["long", "out", "around", "in"], ["with", "on", "in", "at"], ["stood", "going", "standing", "walking"], ["closing", "closed", "open", "gone"], ["may", "like", "must", "don't"], ["liked", "wanted", "like", "eager"]], "answers": ["D", "D", "D", "C", "B", "B", "C", "C", "D", "C", "C", "A", "C"]}
