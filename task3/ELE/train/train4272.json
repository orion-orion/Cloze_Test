{"article": "My name is Amy. I'm a 25-year-old graduate student who likes yoga, home-decorating shows and eating spoonfuls of peanut butter _ from the jar. Oh yeah, and I'm an iPhone addict. I wasn't always an addict. In fact, for many years I told myself I didn't want a _ cellphone. They seemed like too much work, always beeping, ringing and _ attention. I was _ content with my simple antique (,), and I didn't expect to change my mind any time soon. However, about a year ago, I found myself envious of all those proud iPhone owners, cradling their shiny new phones and showing them off to all their friends. I started listening secretly to conversations about \"iPhone apps\", feeling like a _ listening to a language I couldn't speak. Eventually I couldn't _ my iPhone instinct any longer, and I welcomed my new iPhone into my life. To my surprise, I suddenly found myself with a whole new circle of friends.

However, I realized I had a problem when one day I found myself Google-mapping my way to my mailbox, which happens to be right outside my front door.

I decided _ had to be done. But, as I quickly realized, iPhones are like _ and not easy to quit. Then, while taking the bus to work one day, I was _ forced to quit--at least _ . When I reached into my purse to grab Eloise, (to refer to my e-mail for only the seventh time that morning), I found her _ by fever. She was so hot that I dropped her immediately back into my bag.
