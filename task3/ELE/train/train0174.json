{"article": "Someone recently asked me when I became more confident about my abilities as an entrepreneur. I thought it was a funny question, _ I' not very confident at all, and constantly filled with _ about every decision I make. It doesn't exactly hold me back in my work; it's just that I am very _ of what I do, and I'm always _ on the way I work, think and talk. I have also learned over the years that making a decision is often more important than making the _ decision. Preferably your decisions are the right ones, but inaction or indecisiveness is more _ than making the wrong decisions every now and then. There is one thing I have learned over the years that I wish I had learned earlier in my career. And that is the _ that I am not stupid. It sounds logical, but I often sat in on meetings and heard people explain things and then _ to myself, \" I don't understand that. Maybe I'm stupid?\" or I would hear about a startup and I wouldn't _ their business model and think I'm stupid. Or I would hear an entrepreneur speak and think, \" That all like _ bullshit, but I must be stupid, because other people seem to love it.\" A couple of years ago, I came to the _ that I was not stupid at all. When people in meetings say things I don't' understand I _ up and tell them so. Usually, I hear a sigh of _ in the room and find out nobody understood what was being talked about. When I don't understand a business model it usually means there is not one, or it _ . Turns out I'm not stupid and _ I don't understand it, most people won't understand it at all. Apart from doubting my own abilities I've learned to _ my \"bullshit radar\" a bit more and not understanding something is a clear sign that something is _ . My advice to young entrepreneurs is this: you are not stupid! If something does not make _ , if it sounds stupid, if you don't understand it, something is wrong! Trust your gut _ . Feel free not to know and be honest when you don't' understand something!", "options": [["if", "unless", "because", "when"], ["disappointment", "doubt", "terror", "curiosity"], ["conscious", "tired", "ashamed", "fond"], ["insisting", "working", "relying", "reflecting"], ["right", "tough", "firm", "final"], ["boring", "costly", "disgusting", "significant"], ["truth", "concept", "realization", "reputation"], ["thought", "referred", "smiled", "came"], ["mind", "know", "love", "understand"], ["tastes", "sounds", "smells", "looks"], ["compromise", "conclusion", "point", "agreement"], ["speak", "look", "hang", "cheer"], ["despair", "pleasure", "relief", "impatience"], ["disappears", "ceases", "approaches", "sucks"], ["since", "if", "as", "while"], ["operate", "differentiate", "trust", "inspect"], ["in", "up", "on", "off"], ["progress", "history", "money", "sense"], ["feeling", "level", "happiness", "Comfort"]], "answers": ["C", "B", "A", "D", "A", "B", "C", "A", "D", "B", "B", "B", "C", "D", "B", "C", "D", "D", "B"]}
