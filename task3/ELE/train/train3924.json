What's more, he is quite different from others in ideas and _ : beating or bringing to account his son in the presence of neighbors as he strongly believes in such a _ : a dutiful son is the _ of the rod, which is deeply impressed in his mind from his father. So I was emotionally upset and _ in spite of just a 10-year-old kid, who thought, \"I was randomly beaten, so I would bring blows on other smaller kids\". And Dad would deal me a heavier _ the next time. It turned out that I completely lost control of this blow and found it impossible for me to _ on my lessons as I came to blows with other kids all day long.
