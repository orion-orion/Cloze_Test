The company's past _ had blinded the authorities to the need for change, and they _ new ideas and would say \"This is the way we've always done it.\". As the years went by, BJ grew more and more _ with their short-sightedness. Finally, she left the company. But she found that she hadn't left her _ behind when she resigned. She carried it with her, like \"rocks in the stomach\". \"I finally decided to _ about my experiences and my feelings. I _ it would be a good mental health _ . I wanted to be rid of that company and those people, once and for all. So I wrote and wrote. It wasn't just a story that poured out -- it was a whole _ ! My resentment _ my writing. The whole world would know how _ they were!\" \"What _ when the book came out?\" I asked BJ. \"Not much,\" she replied, \"The newspaper kept doing what it had _ done. My feelings didn't _ them one bit, but it took me several more years to finally get over my negative emotions. Finally, the time came when I decided to make amends for the angry things I had said about the company. I _ my former boss to dinner and made my _ . I told him I was sorry for being so resentful. It was a great healing process for me.\" \"What was the _ outcome?\" I asked her. \"Gratitude,\" she replied, \"Not only wasn't I resentful any more, but I was grateful to the company. If I hadn't had those _ experiences, I never would have written a book. And the book became hugely successful -- now _ in 21 languages. In short, my resentment gave way to gratitude.\" She smiled, \"I owe them a debt of thanks for giving me such a great tale to tell.\" Trading resentments for gratitude isn't always easy. But it's worth it, _ gratitude is a far happier feeling than resentment.", "options": [["skill", "management", "success", "business"], ["resisted", "got", "broke", "shaped"], ["moved", "frustrated", "excited", "surprised"], ["sadness", "worry", "doubt", "anger"], ["think", "care", "write", "talk"], ["proved", "figured", "concluded", "agreed"], ["exercise", "suggestion", "lecture", "theory"], ["diary", "lesson", "accident", "book"], ["prevented", "delayed", "fueled", "corrected"], ["sensitive", "successful", "greedy", "stupid"], ["happened", "reported", "received", "resulted"], ["sometimes", "always", "recently", "already"], ["forgive", "reward", "bother", "cheat"], ["invited", "called", "persuaded", "followed"], ["promise", "apology", "plan", "decision"], ["only", "natural", "direct", "final"], ["useful", "funny", "painful", "shameful"], ["finished", "edited", "read", "published"], ["for", "though", "but", "and"]], "answers": ["C", "A", "B", "D", "C", "B", "A", "D", "C", "D", "A", "B", "C", "A", "B", "D", "C", "D", "A"]}
