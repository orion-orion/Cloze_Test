{"article": "Two weeks before Christmas, Mother told me we were going to my grandmother's house for the holiday. Grandma and Uncle Henry lived on a farm some 15 miles out of town They had no electricity or running water and _ what I considered the \"good things\" in life. They _ made no plans for Christmas When Christmas Eve arrived, Mom told me in her best \"I-mean-it\" voice to _ all the decorations from our tree. She packed those up along with all the materials for a _ turkey dinner. Christmas morning _ perfectly with the sun shining brightly across a fresh blanket of snow. _ I was angry silently in the backseat of the car as we made our _ to grandma's. This was going to be the _ Christmas ever! Grandma was _ to see us as we walked up to her door. \"What on earth are you doing here?\" she said.\" We weren't expecting anyone . It's Christmas, and I don't even have a turkey to cook for you.\" \"I knew _ \" Mom said as we set boxes of goodies on the kitchen table. \"That's _ we brought all with us.\" \"We _ have a tree\" Mom insisted. \" Or rather what will we do with all these decorations?\" Uncle Henry quickly caught Mom's spirit. He called me to join him, and we found a perfect Christmas tree in the woods. Soon the house _ fresh and piney as we decorated the pine tree, and the day took on a festive air . The turkey dinner was very good, too. I was actually beginning to enjoy this unusual Christmas day! Dessert was almost forgotten _ Mom came out with the final surprise-a flaming pudding! \"Merry Christmas, mother,\" Mom said. \"Dear me!\" Grandma said with her mouth wide open. \"I haven't seen a flaming pudding since I left England before I was married.\" Tears of _ filled her eyes. I could not keep the tears _ my eyes, either. I knew then that Mom had also given me the best Christmas present ever. She had taught me what a beautiful thing it is to give.", "options": [["wanted", "lacked", "refused", "prepared"], ["also", "still", "never", "hardly"], ["replace", "collect", "remove", "cover"], ["normal", "complete", "fresh", "separate"], ["dawned", "passed", "broke", "happened"], ["But", "So", "And", "Then"], ["decision", "Way", "wish", "plan"], ["last", "busiest", "best", "worst"], ["expected", "crazy", "surprised", "ready"], ["you", "it", "that", "this"], ["how", "why", "where", "what"], ["may", "will", "can", "must"], ["improved", "smelled", "became", "changed"], ["until", "after", "because", "unless"], ["sadness", "joy", "regret", "worry"], ["outside", "back", "away", "from"]], "answers": ["B", "A", "C", "B", "A", "A", "B", "D", "C", "C", "B", "D", "B", "A", "B", "D"]}
