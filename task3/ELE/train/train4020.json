{"article": "I was in a hotel ballroom in Washington, back in 2004, to cover the National Spelling Bee . One of the 265 kids was Akshay Buddiga, a 13-year-old from Colorado Springs. His brother had _ the bee two years before, and Akshay wanted to _ his brother's success. You could learn at Harvard University all day and _ hear the words used in the National Spelling Bee. These words live in the _ corners of dictionaries. Each speller steps up to the microphone, and the official pronouncer 45 _ a word.

He _ the word, but there was a problem. In his head, he saw two _ spellings and he couldn't decide which was right. He had two minutes to _ the word. He asked to hear the word again, trying to _ between the two versions in his head. He jammed his hands in his pockets. Without knowing it, he stood so straight that he _ his knees.

She spoke right away , \"That's correct.\" Akshay ended up finishing second. He later said a lot was going through his mind when he was _ there. \"Mostly, all the work that I'd done,\" he added.
