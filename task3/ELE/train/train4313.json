In her senior year of high school, her English teacher was Mrs. Dorothy Slaton. Mrs. Slaton was a _ , demanding teacher with high standards and a low _ for excuses. She refused to treat her students like _ , instead expecting them to behave like the _ adults they would have to be to succeed in the real world after graduation. Jean was _ of her at first but grew to respect her firmness and fairness gradually. One day Mrs. Slaton gave the class a written _ . \"What do you think you'll be doing 10 years from now?\" Jean's dream was to be a pilot like her father, but as the years went by, she had been beaten down by the _ and negative words she got whenever she talked about her career, so she unwillingly gave it up and wrote something else. Mrs. Slaton collected the papers and nothing more was said. Two weekslater, the teacher handed back the assignments, _ the students to face it down on the desk, and asked this question: \"If you had enough finances and unlimited _ , what would you do? Please write it on the _ of your previous assignment paper.\" When the students stopped writing, the teacher asked, \"How many of you wrote the same thing on _ sides of the paper?\" Not one hand went up. The next thing that Mrs. Slaton said changed the course of Jean's life. The teacher leaned forward _ her desk and said, \"I have a little secret for you all. You do have _ abilities and talents. You do have access to the finest schools, and you can arrange plenty of finances if you want something _ enough. This is it!
