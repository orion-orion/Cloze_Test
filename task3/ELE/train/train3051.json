{"article": "I went to my favorite restaurant one evening to have supper. I knew the owner very well. _ I was waiting for the soup to arrive, I looked around to see if I knew anyone in the restaurant. It was _ that I noticed a man sitting at the corner table _ watching in my direction, as if he knew me. The man had a newspaper open in front of him, which he was _ to read, though all the while I could see that he was keeping an eye on me. When the waiter brought the soup, the man was clearly _ by the familiar way in which the waiter and I talked to each other. He became even more puzzled as time went on and it grew more and more obvious that I was well _ in the restaurant. In the end he got up and went to the kitchen. After a few minutes he came _ again, paid his bill and left without _ looking in my direction. When I finished and was _ to pay my bill, I called the owner over and _ him what the man had wanted. The owner at _ didn't want to tell me. I _ \" Well\", he said \" that man was a detective.\" _ ?\" I said, much surprised. \" he followed you here because he _ you were the man he was looking for,\" the owner said. \" He showed me a photo of the _ man. He certainly looked _ you! Of course since we know you here. I was able to make him _ that he had made a mistake.\" \" It's _ I came to a restaurant where I'm where I'm known,\" I said, \" otherwise I _ have been taken to police station!\"", "options": [["While", "After", "Before", "Until"], ["time", "then", "here", "there"], ["began", "enjoyed", "kept", "stopped"], ["pretending", "seen", "prepared", "hold"], ["frightened", "surprised", "puzzled", "pleased"], ["treated", "welcomed", "received", "known"], ["around", "up", "in", "out"], ["another", "all", "any", "each"], ["able", "about", "willing", "anxious"], ["told", "showed", "asked", "gave"], ["last", "first", "least", "once"], ["insisted", "apologized", "wondered", "regretted"], ["Certainly", "Really", "Why", "How"], ["knew", "found", "explain", "thought"], ["strange", "famous", "wanted", "curious"], ["for", "at", "after", "like"], ["believe", "agree", "remember", "learn"], ["necessary", "funny", "lucky", "clear"], ["need", "will", "can", "might"]], "answers": ["A", "B", "C", "A", "C", "D", "D", "A", "B", "C", "B", "A", "B", "D", "C", "D", "A", "C", "D"]}
