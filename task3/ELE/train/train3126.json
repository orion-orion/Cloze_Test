{"article": "Although one might not agree because of some of the criticism of it, advertising is essential to the kind of society in which people in the United Kingdom, and a very _ proportion of the world live. Advertising is necessary as a _ of communicating with others, of telling them about the goods and services that are offered, and of which most of them would never _ to hear at all if it were not for advertising. And advertising helps a great deal to promote a _ standard of living. In talking about advertising, one should not think only in terms of a commercial on television, or an advertisement in the newspapers or periodicals.
