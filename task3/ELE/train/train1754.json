{"article": "Many years ago I drove a taxi for extra money. I drove mainly from the downtown to the _ , beside the Greenwood Racetrack which was in operation at that time. Each time a taxi drove up to the station, many kids would run along the _ to the passenger door. One _ kid would open the passenger door and say, \" Good luck , sir.\" The passenger would always say thanks and give the kid a _ on his way from the taxi to the entrance of the track. It was a routine that everybody knew. One day I noticed a boy, who was _ than most of them but was pushed away by even the smallest kid. He never pushed back. In fact , he would even step aside when others pushed forward. But he never gave up . Then one morning as I was pulling up to the sidewalk, all the other kids were running after a taxi in front of mine. They didn't notice mine. The boy saw me and walked toward my taxi. As I pulled up I made sure that I stopped in a _ with the passenger door right beside him. He _ the passenger door with a flourish and said, \"Good luck at the track, sir.\" _ , the man did not tip him a quarter. Instead he _ , \"Get out of my way!\" He pushed him aside so _ that the boy fell on the sidewalk and I knew he was badly hurt. I got out of my car quickly only to find that the man disappeared in the crowd. So I looked for the kid. I decided to give him $20 for all his _ . But he was far up ahead, walking out of the station _ . The traffic policeman waved at me to get my car going. From then on , I never saw him again. I'd like to find him one day and tell him that if only he had stuck around a little longer I would have given him a whole $20. I learned an important lesson from the boy.
