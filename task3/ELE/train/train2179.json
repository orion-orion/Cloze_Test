It didn't even cross my mind that he might feel _ when people whispered about him. So I just let them talk. Then came the day when I learned my brother Captain's testing for autism came out positive . I had never thought about him like that. I broke _ , crying. Everything had just changed. He was no longer a(n) _ little boy. Over time, I was able to accept his _ a little more. We had to _ because Captain needed treatment. So Captain and I both started at a new school. One day, I was standing in the bus line waiting when a \"short\" bus (for the retarded) came and _ some kids up.

My mouth opened and this came out:\"I don't think we should make fun of the short bus, because there are people on that bus who have a lot in common with us and have the same feelings as we do.\" I could feel my _ getting louder. \"So I would _ it if you didn't make fun of them.\" The room was very quiet and everyone stared at me. My teacher _ for the words and then started the song again. At the end of the class, everyone was giving me strange looks. But I didn't _ , because I knew three things: I had spoken the _ . I had taught everyone something, and while everyone in the classroom was being a follower, I had _ to take a different path since I wanted to become a _ and a role model.", "options": [["amazed", "hurt", "uncertain", "cold"], ["off", "in", "down", "away"], ["normal", "noisy", "outstanding", "impressive"], ["pain", "interest", "opinion", "illness"], ["change", "move", "quit", "study"], ["set", "took", "brought", "picked"], ["jokes", "complaints", "choices", "discoveries"], ["violent", "strange", "confusing", "clear"], ["because", "if", "but", "so"], ["chance", "position", "topic", "point"], ["encouraged", "bothered", "enjoyed", "stopped"], ["bad", "embarrassed", "tense", "guilty"], ["sat", "slowed", "quieted", "looked"], ["pace", "voice", "pulse", "breath"], ["excuse", "appreciate", "stand", "permit"], ["apologized", "fought", "allowed", "argued"], ["understand", "notice", "return", "care"], ["wisdom", "importance", "matter", "truth"], ["helped", "decided", "agreed", "hoped"], ["reporter", "thinker", "leader", "trainer"]], "answers": ["B", "C", "A", "D", "B", "D", "A", "B", "C", "A", "D", "A", "C", "B", "B", "A", "D", "D", "B", "C"]}
