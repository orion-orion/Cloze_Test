{"article": "Once upon a time a king, in the company of his ministers, went to the imperial garden for a walk. When he was walking around a pond, a strange idea _ upon him and he asked, \"How many buckets of water are there in the pond?\" The ministers looked at each other, _ to give an answer. Rather _ , the king ordered, \"You have three days' grace. Any one who offers an answer will be handsomely awarded. Those who fail will be _ .\" The time limit was due in the twinkling of an eye, yet the ministers were still at their wit's end. At this time a child appeared who declared that he knew the answer. The king told his _ ministers to go with the child for the measurement. To their _ , the child refused the suggestion with a smile, \"It is very easy. No _ to go to the pond.\" This made the king laugh _ , \"Alright, let us know what it is.\" The child winked and said, \"That _ on the size of the bucket. If it is as big as the pond, there is one bucket of water; if it is half as big, two buckets; if one third as big, three buckets; if...\"\"Stop! That's it. You've got the _ .\" The king was satisfied and the child was duly rewarded. Why did the ministers feel it so different to settle the problem? Because they fell in a pitfall , following a wrong way of thinking. People's thinking often goes a habitual way -- the beaten track of straightforwardness. _ is a static way presupposing every object definite and certain, i.e. the size of the pond and the bucket should be clearly _ . If one of them is unknown, it will be difficult to do the measurement, let alone _ . Why not change your mode of thought -- from static to dynamic , from concrete to _ ? If you adopt an indirect way and try to find out the proportional relation between the pond and the bucket, you'll get an answer -- flexible yet _ to solve the problem. Sometimes to get out of the difficulty one must change one's way of thinking, or simply change one's approach towards a problem.", "options": [["fixed", "focused", "came", "looked"], ["struggling", "thinking", "falling", "failing"], ["disappointed", "excited", "pleased", "contented"], ["killed", "punished", "blamed", "scolded"], ["exciting", "amazing", "surprising", "trembling"], ["doubt", "surprise", "envy", "delight"], ["good", "use", "need", "wonder"], ["wonderfully", "joyfully", "cheerfully", "doubtfully"], ["decides", "depends", "calls", "looks"], ["award", "reward", "answer", "number"], ["This", "That", "It", "Such"], ["marked", "measured", "signed", "known"], ["another", "other", "one", "both"], ["detailed", "easy", "simple", "abstract"], ["acceptable", "available", "adequate", "proper"]], "answers": ["C", "D", "A", "B", "D", "B", "C", "D", "B", "C", "C", "D", "D", "D", "C"]}
