{"article": "A flock of wild ducks were flying in formation, heading south for the winter. They formed a beautiful V in the sky, and were admired by everyone who saw them from below. One day, Wally, one of the wild ducks in the formation, spotted something on the ground. It was a barnyard with a flock of _ ducks who lived on the farm. They were waddling around on the ground, quacking merrily and eating _ that was thrown on the ground for them every day. Wally liked what he saw. \"It sure would be nice to have some of that corn,\" he thought to himself. \"And all this flying is very tiring. I'd like to just _ around for a while.\" So after thinking it over a while, Wally left the formation of wild ducks, made a sharp _ , and _ for the barnyard. He landed _ the tame ducks, and began to waddle around and quack _ . He also started eating corn. The formation of wild ducks continued their journey South, but Wally didn't care. \"I'll _ them when they come back North in a few months,\" he said to himself. Several months went by and _ enough, Wally looked up and spotted the flock of wild ducks in formation, heading north. They looked beautiful up there. And Wally was tired of the _ . It was muddy and everywhere he waddled, there was nothing but duck doo. \"It's time to leave.\" said Wally. So Wally _ his wings furiously and tried to get airborne. But he had gained some _ from all his corn-eating, and he hadn't exercised his wings much either. He finally got off the ground, but he was flying too _ and slammed into the side of the barn. He fell to the ground with a thud and said to himself, \"Oh, well, I'll just wait until they fly _ in a few months. Then I'll rejoin them and become a wild duck again.\" When the flock flew overhead once more, Wally again tried to _ himself out of the barnyard. But he simply didn't have the strength. Every winter and every spring, he saw his wild duck friends flying overhead, and they would call out to him. But his attempts to leave were all in vain Eventually Wally no longer paid any attention to the wild ducks flying overhead. He hardly even noticed them. He had after all , become a barnyard duck.", "options": [["tame", "ugly", "beautiful", "wild"], ["food", "grain", "corn", "vegetable"], ["rest", "waddle", "walk", "fly"], ["turn", "dive", "land", "circle"], ["hurried", "looked", "left", "headed"], ["between", "among", "behind", "within"], ["loudly", "sadly", "merrily", "eagerly"], ["see", "recognize", "leave", "rejoin"], ["strange", "lucky", "sure", "natural"], ["barnyard", "corn", "waddling", "quacking"], ["flapped", "spread", "removed", "opened"], ["strength", "skills", "friends", "weight"], ["slowly", "fast", "high", "low"], ["back", "south", "north", "overhead"], ["lift", "fly", "struggle", "rise"]], "answers": ["A", "C", "B", "B", "D", "B", "C", "D", "C", "A", "A", "D", "D", "B", "A"]}
