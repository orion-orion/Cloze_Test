{"article": "There is a sharing policy at my son's preschool. The policy is that a child can keep a toy as long as they want to. If another child wants the toy, they have to _ until the first child is done with it. We are _ \"save\" toys for the child if they have to go to the bathroom, or go to the snack table, etc. so that it won't be _ before they are done. This applies to anything in the school that can be played with , including swings and monkey bars. That is the _ that all the kids know, so they don't feel uncomfortable when you tell them, \"You can have it was Sally Joe is done.\" But _ I've been noticing a totally different attitude towards 42 _ in other places where I go. Gradually , I'm starting to _ why the rule of the school is important. Here is a(n) _ of sharing practices that I've seen lately. My good friend and her _ were at the park one day. He had 46 _ a small car from home to play with. Another child, a lot bit _ , wanted to play with the car and was demanding that my friend's son _ him the car. A typical little boy fighting started. I stopped them _ . I heard the other mother told her son angrily, \"I guess his mom didn't _ him how to share\", which I don't think so. I think that it is _ to teach a child that he should have something that someone else has, simply because he wants it. _ it belongs to someone else, not yours. If you want to share his, \"No\" is a perfectly _ response, unless he's ready to share with you or you _ it with something. Even if it is something public, when another is playing it, you should wait for your _ politely. Therefore, how to share and how to treat it are important.", "options": [["see", "wait", "say", "cry"], ["ever", "yet", "even", "also"], ["taken", "studied", "damaged", "improved"], ["difficulty", "growth", "rule", "answer"], ["finally", "immediately", "rarely", "recently"], ["working", "helping", "sharing", "supporting"], ["understand", "wonder", "decide", "suggest"], ["way", "example", "step", "idea"], ["son", "daughter", "sister", "brother"], ["brought", "borrowed", "sent", "picked"], ["cooler", "older", "slower", "cleverer"], ["make", "buy", "give", "promise"], ["strangely", "happily", "heavily", "hurriedly"], ["ask", "control", "teach", "force"], ["necessary", "harmful", "special", "powerful"], ["Imagine", "Guess", "Doubt", "Remember"], ["wrong", "hard", "normal", "great"], ["develop", "fill", "compare", "exchange"], ["use", "turn", "chance", "result"]], "answers": ["B", "C", "A", "C", "D", "C", "A", "B", "A", "A", "B", "C", "D", "C", "B", "D", "C", "D", "B"]}
