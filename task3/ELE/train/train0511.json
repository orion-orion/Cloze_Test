{"article": "One Sunday, a picture in the newspaper touched me. A young woman stood in front of a totally destroyed home. A little boy stood beside her with his head _ . Holding her skirt tightly was a tiny girl, eyes wide with _ and fear. With growing _ I noticed that their sizes of each family member closely _ ours. This would be a good opportunity to _ my children, so I explained their difficult _ to my seven-year-old twins and three-year-old Meghan. \"We have so much, but these poor people now have nothing,\" I said, \"we'll _ what we have with them.\" I brought three large boxes and placed them on the living room floor. Meghan watched seriously _ the boys and I filled one box with canned food. While I sorted through our clothes, I encouraged the boys to go through their toys and _ some of their less favorite things. Meghan watched _ as the boys piled up useless toys in the box. \"I'll help you find something for the little girl,\" I said to her. The boys placed the toys they had _ to donate into one of the boxes while I filled the third box with clothes. Meghan walked up with Lucy, her worn, faded, much-loved doll _ tightly to her chest. She _ in front of the box, pressed her little face into Lucy's face, gave her a _ kiss, then, laid her gently on top of the other toys. \"Oh, honey,\" I said. \"You don't have to give away Lucy. You love her so much.\" Meghan nodded, eyes shining with tears. \"Lucy makes me happy, Mommy. _ she'll make that little girl happy, too.\" I stared at Meghan for a long moment, _ how I could teach the boys the lesson she had just taught me. It's easy to give what we don't want any more, but _ to let go of things we cherish, isn't it? _ , the true spirit of giving is to give with your heart.", "options": [["off", "up", "down", "round"], ["smile", "confusion", "joy", "anger"], ["happiness", "friendship", "puzzle", "interest"], ["matched", "equaled", "compared", "suited"], ["help", "complain", "change", "teach"], ["experience", "problem", "situation", "process"], ["give", "share", "send", "spare"], ["as", "since", "though", "because"], ["donate", "leave", "keep", "sell"], ["hopefully", "anxiously", "depressingly", "quietly"], ["separated", "chosen", "bought", "confirmed"], ["hugged", "tied", "grasped", "caught"], ["settled", "regretted", "paused", "cried"], ["precious", "final", "hearty", "lovely"], ["Also", "Yet", "Maybe", "Though"], ["knowing", "wondering", "realizing", "expecting"], ["available", "necessary", "important", "hard"], ["However", "Therefore", "Otherwise", "Moreover"]], "answers": ["C", "B", "D", "A", "D", "C", "B", "A", "A", "D", "B", "A", "C", "B", "C", "B", "D", "A"]}
