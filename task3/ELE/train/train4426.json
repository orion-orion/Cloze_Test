The balloon competitions were always something really special.  Each time, the flying insects were favourite _ to win, because they could seize the balloon strings and fly off in all directions, creating all sorts of 58 _ in the air. _ , on this occasion there were some rather unusual insects taking part: a group of ants. Of course, _ expected that they could do anything special. They were so light that no ant had ever _ to take part, but it was quite impressive to see all the ants all _ organized and prepared.
