{"article": "On one of those perfectly sunny grandma-babysitting days, we set off to play in a nearby park. Kids were _ the merry-go-round and the swings. But what _ my four-year-old grandson was the tennis court . Two kids were riding their bikes in and out of the lines on the newly finished _ . Their parents sat on a bench just inside the gated entrance. The kids laughed as they _ one another. A sign was clearly posted on the entrance--No _ Allowed. Just beginning his reading lesson, my grandson _ knew the word \"No\". He asked me what _ came next. I told him that the _ asked people not to ride bikes on the tennis court. He was just four years old, _ he could clearly see two kids riding their bikes where they shouldn't be _ . We watched for a little while and then he reached up to _ the gate. I thought that he wanted to watch the kids more clearly. _ , he walked straight over to the couple and asked if they _ what the sign said. Oh, what a _ four-year-old! The man gave me an unfriendly look and then said _ that it didn't matter. I led my grandson away from the tennis court and told him that sometimes people don't like _ rules.
