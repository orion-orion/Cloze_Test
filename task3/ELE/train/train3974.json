{"article": "This little story I'm about to tell you happened when I was about 11 years old, and I'II never forget it. I was at my friend Jenny's _ after school one day, and we were doing (or not doing) homework.. _ I was there, Jenny's mom came over to visit. I don't remember her name _ what her face looked like. I just remember her hands, her voice and the _ she taught me. I can still see her hand reaching out for mine in our introduction. _ were so beautiful, I thought; rich, dark skin _ complemented by the orange colored polish on her nails. Then I _ her saying, and not at all in a condescending _ .\"Oh no, that is NOT how you shake hands. Let me show you _ .\" After that, I just remember her voice _ the importance of a good handshake, conveying a positive sense of self, looking at the other person in the eye, making that first moment matter...I think in that exchange I first understood _ . I respected her for _ the time to teach me about one of those subtleties in life. I appreciated the fact _ she didn't look down upon me because I was 11 or because I didn't know something. And so because of that I felt somewhat respected. I mean the _ she treated me. It felt good to be talked to like a real person. I also appreciate her idea that if someone doesn't pay attention to something, be patient and point him or her _ the right direction. I think of her every time I meet someone and shake hands. And I'm so thankful for her little lesson.", "options": [["office", "house", "family", "room"], ["Although", "As", "During", "If"], ["and", "but", "even", "or"], ["homework", "English", "lesson", "knowledge"], ["It", "That", "These", "They"], ["patiently", "beautifully", "strongly", "thickly"], ["listened", "found", "heard", "saw"], ["manner", "means", "method", "voice"], ["that", "it", "how", "what"], ["explains", "explained", "explain", "explaining"], ["politeness", "saying", "friendship", "respect"], ["costing", "spending", "taking", "using"], ["what", "which", "that", "/"], ["place", "position", "way", "time"], ["from", "at", "in", "to"]], "answers": ["D", "B", "D", "C", "D", "B", "C", "A", "C", "D", "D", "C", "C", "C", "C"]}
