{"article": "As we all know, Chinese handwriting has infinite power to express differences of character and cultivation. But we have to admit that traditional handwriting has become a _ art, now that kids start using keyboards as soon as they begin school. However, writing things out by hand may be a _ way we train our brains, several studies suggest. Many psychologists think that handwriting can make you _ ! Writing by hand is different from _ because it requires using strokes to create a letter, rather than just selecting the whole letter by touching a key, says Virginia Berninger, a professor of psychology at the University of Washington. These _ movements activate large regions of the brain _ in thinking, memory, and language. Handwriting helps children learn letters and shapes, improves their composition of ideas, and may also _ fine-motor skills development. A study by Berninger found that in grades two, four, and six, children wrote more words, faster, and expressed more _ when writing essays by hand than when typing on a keyboard. A separate study by researchers at Indiana University found that children who practiced printing by hand had more active _ than kids who _ looked at letters. It's not just children who _ from writing things out by hand, says a study in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience. Adults learning a new language remember its _ better if they write them out by hand than if they produce them with a keyboard. As more people _ their days on the computer, says neuroscientist P. Murali Doraiswamy of Duke University, \" _ people in handwriting skills could be a useful cognitive exercise.\"", "options": [["charming", "dying", "mixing", "challenging"], ["common", "critical", "classic", "standard"], ["smarter", "calmer", "deeper", "quicker"], ["clicking", "talking", "typing", "moving"], ["body", "eye", "letter", "finger"], ["ended", "led", "included", "involved"], ["boost", "weaken", "decline", "prospect"], ["meanings", "ideas", "information", "emotions"], ["mood", "behavior", "fingers", "brains"], ["simply", "rarely", "hardly", "specially"], ["benefit", "keep", "result", "learn"], ["rules", "sounds", "characters", "sentences"], ["get", "waste", "spend", "rely"], ["retreating", "returning", "repeating", "retraining"]], "answers": ["B", "B", "A", "C", "D", "D", "A", "B", "D", "A", "A", "C", "C", "D"]}
