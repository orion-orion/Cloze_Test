{"article": "Robby' piano lessons With the encouragement from my friends, I am writing this story. My name is Mildred Hondorf. I am a former elementary school music teacher from DeMoines, Iowa. I've always taught piano lessons in my spare time to supplement my income. Over the years I found that children have many levels of musical ability. Although I have taught some _ students, I've also had my share of what I call \"musically challenged\" pupils. One such student is Robby. Robby was 11 years old when his mother (a single mom) took him for his _ piano lesson. I _ that students (especially boys) begin at an earlier age, which I _ to Robby. But Robby said that it had always been his mother's dream to hear him play the piano. So I took him as a _ .  _ Robby tried very hard, he didn't have the basic sense of music. However, he continued and at the end of each weekly lesson he would always say, \"My mom's going to hear me play some day.\" But it seemed _ . I only knew his mother from a distance as she dropped Robby off or waited in her old car to _ him up. She always waved and smiled but _ stopped in. Then one day Robby stopped coming to our lessons. He _ me and said his mother was sick. I also was glad that he stopped coming. He was a bad _ for my teaching! Several weeks later I was _ my students for the music show when Robby came and asked me if he could be in it. \"Miss Hondorf.....I've just got to _ \" he said. I don't know what led me to _ him to play in the show. Maybe it was his persistence or maybe it was something inside of me saying that it would be all right. The night for the show came. The high school gym was packed with parents, friends and relations. The show went off well. Then Robby came up on stage. I was _ when he announced that he had chosen one of the most difficult pieces of Mozart. I was not prepared for what I heard next. His _ were light on the keys. They even danced on the keys... He played so well that everyone was on their feet _ excitedly. In tears I ran up on stage, \"Oh, Robby! _ would you do it?\" \"Well Miss Hondorf... I kept on practising at home. Remember I told you my mom was sick? Well, in fact she had cancer and passed away this morning. And well... she was born _ , so tonight was the first time she ever heard me. I wanted to make it special.\"", "options": [["ordinary", "young", "silly", "talented"], ["first", "second", "next", "last"], ["refer", "prefer", "permit", "reject"], ["complained", "replied", "explained", "responded"], ["brother", "boy", "student", "teacher"], ["Although", "Because", "Since", "Unless"], ["careless", "hopeless", "homeless", "useless"], ["call", "pick", "keep", "wake"], ["always", "usually", "sometimes", "never"], ["asked", "invited", "telephoned", "told"], ["advertisement", "interviewee", "colleague", "contribution"], ["providing", "searching", "preparing", "asking"], ["go", "leave", "play", "dance"], ["demand", "hope", "suggest", "allow"], ["excited", "surprised", "happy", "satisfied"], ["eyes", "arms", "fingers", "legs"], ["spotting", "clapping", "equipping", "stopping"], ["What", "When", "Where", "How"], ["deaf", "blind", "sick", "expert"]], "answers": ["D", "A", "B", "C", "C", "A", "B", "B", "D", "C", "A", "C", "C", "D", "B", "C", "B", "D", "A"]}
