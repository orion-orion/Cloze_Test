{"article": "Storing ice in the Antarctic Where do you keep _ ? In the freezer, of course. That's what scientists might have thought _ they were looking for a safe place to store ice from mountain glaciers _ around the world. They've decided to store ice in Antarctica because global warming is causing some of the glaciers in places like the Alps to melt. Jerome Chappellaz of the French National Centre _ Scientific Research is involved in _ an ice vault there. He says: \"We are probably the only scientific community _ archive is in danger _ disappearing from the face of _ planet. If you work on corals, on marine sediments, on tree rings, the raw material is still here and will be for many centuries\". And why do scientists need to study ice _ the Alps, for example? Ice formed on the _ of a mountain is made of layers of snow accumulated over thousands of years. Trapped air bubbles containsamples of the atmosphere _ existed when that ice was formed. Ice is a _ of climate, according to polaroceanographer Mark Brandon from the Open University in Britain. He says: \"We know carbon dioxidein the atmosphere is higher now than in the last three million years\". Researchers use this _ of data to build computer models and try to _ what might happen in the future. The ice vault will be _ in a snow cave at the Concordia Research Station, which is operated by scientists from France and Italy. The ice samples will be _ in bags and placed 10m below the surface, at a _ temperature of -50C. This will put the scientists' minds at rest. Commercial freezers break down , power failures happen and losing the ice samples would be a disaster. Nobody wants to see a mine of scientific knowledge lost for ever in a giant puddle.", "options": [["ice", "place", "glaciers", "tea"], ["where", "what", "when", "that"], ["in", "from", "throughout", "around"], ["in", "to", "for", "between"], ["finding", "discovering", "creating", "designing"], ["whose", "that", "what", "which"], ["with", "of", "to", "in"], ["the", "a", "an", "one"], ["in", "for", "with", "from"], ["summit", "top", "highlight", "height"], ["where", "what", "when", "that"], ["copy", "record", "diary", "work"], ["kind", "type", "sort", "kinds"], ["guess", "find", "estimate", "predict"], ["housed", "put", "placed", "held"], ["sealed", "sighed", "put", "loaded"], ["stable", "temporory", "constant", "hard"]], "answers": ["A", "C", "B", "C", "C", "A", "B", "A", "D", "A", "D", "B", "A", "D", "A", "A", "C"]}
