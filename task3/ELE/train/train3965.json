{"article": "School children are now constantly asked by their parents and teachers to study harder and harder.And the competition _ the students themselves is growing in most schools in China.In my opinion,the fierce _ in school _ more harm than good. Visiting a German city,I was invited to be present at a parentteacher meeting at a school. _ were told at the meeting that their children's school grades were held to be personal information protected by the law,and that the school would not disclose the students' marks, nor would it report them to the parents.It is their view that a _ school should encourage children to learn _ without pressure.A student's intelligence and ability will be judged later by competition in society. In China,ranking students according to their examination has been used as a means of encouraging students to study harder.A friend told me about a parentteacher meeting she _ with her daughter who was in the second grade. At the meeting,a teacher read aloud a list of students in the class and their marks for different subjects .Good students came at the top of the list and poor _ at the bottom.And in front of everybody at the meeting,the teacher gave warnings _ those poor students and their parents. From this comparison,I conclude that teachers and school leaders in China ought to learn a little more about children's psychology and show their students more _ .Such competition among students is unhealthy and should not be encouraged .", "options": [["over", "between", "among", "beyond"], ["pain", "competition", "study", "argument"], ["makes", "gives", "lets", "does"], ["Parents", "Children", "Teachers", "Students"], ["successful", "wellknown", "excellent", "ordinary"], ["happily", "lazily", "inactively", "friendly"], ["went", "joined", "attended", "present"], ["those", "one", "ones", "boys"], ["from", "to", "with", "off"], ["marks", "homework", "books", "respect"]], "answers": ["C", "B", "D", "A", "A", "A", "C", "C", "B", "D"]}
