{"article": "I remember one Thanksgiving when our family had no money and no food, and someone came knocking on our door. A man was _ there with a huge box of food, a giant turkey and even some _ to cook it in. I couldn't _ it. My dad demanded, \"Who are you? Where are you from?\" The stranger announced, \"I'm here because a friend of yours knows you're in need and that you wouldn't accept _ help, so I've brought this for you. Have a great Thanksgiving.\" My father said, \"No, no, we can't accept this.\" The stranger replied, \"You don't have a choice \" , closed the door and left.
