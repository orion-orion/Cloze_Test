{"article": "Ever since I was little I loved doing things for other people. As I got older I began doing random things for people. For example, during holidays, such as Christmas, I would make an extra _ along with the ones for my relatives. Then I would go and find someone in the grocery store and just hand it to them and walk away. It was so much fun. I admit, _ , the first time I did it I was so _ . I didn't know who to give the card to. So I said a little prayer and knew that the _ person would just appear. About that time an elderly man ran _ me with his shopping cart. It was an accident, and he _ ), handed him the card, and smiled. I said Happy Holidays, and then walked away. It was so great, and the _ I had afterwards was unexplainable. Then one day I came across your website (the coolest website ever) and _ some Smile Cards. When they came in, I started a new project. When I go into a store, I locate a person who I think needs a _ . Then, I buy a flower, a carnation, to be exact, and _ it in the most beautiful paper they have. I tie lots of ribbons on it to make it _ , and then slip the smile card into an envelope and _ it to the flower. After that, I pay for it and explain to the cashier _ it is to go to (I live in a pretty small town so it's easy to get the help of the cashiers). They then give it to that person when they come through.. Once in a while I'll buy the flower and then just leave it for the cashier. That gets smiles. My favorite time was when I picked out this elderly woman who was walking around the _ somewhat confused. I had come across her numerous times and she only smiled slightly once. When she came to the check out (I was watching from outside) her face lit up and the smile was the biggest I had ever seen. Later that week the cashier whom I had had _ me told me that the lady had been so surprised and while she was walking out with the grocery bag to her car, she was planning what she was going to do for someone else. It was awesome. I absolutely love the random acts of kindness cards. I _ at least two in my purse and others in my car, locker and everywhere I go. As I mentioned, my club, STARS, is doing a Random Acts of Kindness Project with the smile cards so they also are using them. I look forward to hearing about their success. It's really great. I _ used them in school. I bought my entire math class cans of pop after lunch one day. They came in from lunch and a can of pop and a smile card were setting on their desks that day. It totally lightened the mood in the class that day _ we were studying for a test. Thank you for all of the help that you provide. The smile cards are a great program that brings smiles into the lives of many!", "options": [["present", "card", "wish", "promise"], ["therefore", "anyway", "moreover", "however"], ["excited", "disappointed", "nervous", "cautious"], ["only", "elderly", "right", "lucky"], ["into", "across", "after", "for"], ["thanked", "apologized", "forgave", "admired"], ["chance", "action", "reward", "feeling"], ["ordered", "copied", "downloaded", "saved"], ["gift", "smile", "help", "comfort"], ["hide", "cover", "put", "wrap"], ["expensive", "natural", "unique", "diverse"], ["devote", "attach", "submit", "join"], ["how", "where", "who", "what"], ["restaurant", "hotel", "school", "store"], ["help", "deliver", "promise", "remind"], ["arrange", "need", "take", "keep"], ["hardly", "somehow", "even", "ever"], ["because", "unless", "after", "whenever"]], "answers": ["B", "D", "C", "C", "A", "B", "D", "A", "B", "D", "C", "B", "C", "D", "A", "D", "C", "A"]}
