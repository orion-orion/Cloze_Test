{"article": "Over the last 15 years, as a doctor, I have had heart-to-heart conversations with countless patients near the end of their lives. The most common emotion they express is _ . And that's _ I came up with a project to encourage people to write a(n) _ letter to their loved ones. It's a lesson I learned years ago from a memorable _ patient. He was a retired _ , who had lived on a staple diet of Semper Fi and studied silence all his life.

She explained to me he had never been much of a _ in their 50-plus years of marriage. But he seemed quite _ to share his ideas with me, especially when it became clear his days were _ . He spoke of his deep regret for not having spent enough time with his wife, whom he loved very much, and of his great 50 _ in his son, who had joined the Navy in his father's footsteps. One afternoon, when I mentioned these _ to his wife and son, they looked disbelievingly at each other and then _ at me. They thanked me for being so kind but _ my patient was unlikely to express such feelings. To make sure his family could actually hear his _ , I took my huge family video camera with me the next morning and with the patients' _ , recorded an open letter from him to his family.
