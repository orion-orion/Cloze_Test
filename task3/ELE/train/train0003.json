{"article": "Most teens I meet these days lack basic social courtesy when dealing with people. My own son, who basically grew up with his grandmother, the original _ guru, has perfect table manners. This is partly because he was _ to manners at a very young age. However, when we eat at home, he would not _ manners. So I asked him why. He said,\" I behave the way I am supposed to _ when I'm out, but when I am at home I want to be _ .\" That's when I realized that most parents, myself included, do _ their children the proper way to behave outside the home, but they are also brought up to believe that at home, anything goes. My _ to him was \"good behavior has nothing to do with where you are or whom you are with\". Then he answered, \"But I behave _ when I'm with others so that they think better of me.\" And that is when I realized that I was doing things all _ . I explained to him that it had nothing to do with what people think. This _ him even more. So I went on to explain that behavior, whether in your everyday _ with people or at the dining table at home, is an _ of who you are. Well, at the age of 13, he got it. So basically, what I am saying is that teaching your children _ comes with the underlying lesson that it is not about _ to do or not to do, but rather, who they are. This way it is not _ ; it comes from within. Teach your teens or children the _ courtesy of greeting their friends' parents and _ themselves when they go to someone's home. Teach teenage boys to open the door of a car, or any door _ that matter, for any girl, whether they are their girlfriends or not. This includes holding elevator doors or letting women step out of the elevator first. Just _ that teenage boys who practice good manners' and courtesy grow up to become men who respect people in general.", "options": [["knowledge", "wisdom", "manners", "intelligence"], ["exposed", "limited", "cared", "concerned"], ["learn", "practice", "remember", "make"], ["live", "Obey", "react", "behave"], ["gentle", "polite", "comfortable", "kind"], ["teach", "offer", "guide", "support"], ["answer", "devotion", "apology", "affection"], ["strangely", "nervously", "calmly", "properly"], ["reasonable", "important", "wrong", "necessary"], ["confused", "encouraged", "moved", "pleased"], ["competition", "argument", "struggle", "interaction"], ["impression", "expression", "appearance", "attitude"], ["lessons", "skills", "manners", "examples"], ["what", "how", "where", "why"], ["practical", "natural", "gradual", "mechanical"], ["minor", "formal", "basic", "casual"], ["pleasing", "Introducing", "enjoying", "amusing"], ["with", "on", "For", "at"], ["consider", "confirm", "predict", "remember"]], "answers": ["C", "A", "B", "D", "C", "A", "A", "D", "C", "A", "D", "B", "C", "A", "D", "C", "B", "C", "D"]}
