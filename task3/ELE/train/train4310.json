{"article": "One very cold and rainy night in the winter of 2012, my husband and I were in a fast food restaurant. We were about to begin our meal _ a man walked in. He was completely _ from the rain and went into the men's room. I watched him go by, then I said to my husband, \"That man must have had nothing to eat in a long time.\" When the man came out of the men's room, he just _ himself in a chair, not going anywhere near the food counter. I _ that he didn't have any money for food and _ wanted to dry off for a while. I just couldn't eat my food knowing that someone else was sitting _ only a few tables away. So, I _ a $20.00 bill from my shopping money to my husband. \"Please get him dinner,\" I said. \"We can do with less money this week.\" My husband _ the man and quietly asked if he needed some food. The man _ at us. \"A small cup of coffee would be great,\" he said. \"Thank you so much!\" He _ wasn't going to take advantage of us, but we _ that he should have a full meal, which he gratefully _ . After he _ the food, he thanked my husband and my husband said, \"No. Thank my _ . She noticed that you were in need .\" The man asked me, \" _ did you know I haven't eaten in a long time?\" I smiled at him and said nothing , just asking him to _ the change from the $20.00. Giving others a _ whenever they're in trouble not only brings happiness to the ones who _ it but also to the ones who give it. I am so grateful that I was able to _ with someone truly in need. It is a little bit of extra warmth on a rainy day.", "options": [["while", "when", "after", "as"], ["angry", "cold", "wet", "energetic"], ["devoted", "found", "helped", "seated"], ["doubted", "guessed", "imagined", "hoped"], ["only", "completely", "occasionally", "hardly"], ["sad", "quiet", "hungry", "silent"], ["handed", "took", "borrowed", "saved"], ["respected", "approached", "begged", "invited"], ["shouted", "laughed", "smiled", "cried"], ["rarely", "easily", "clearly", "immediately"], ["instructed", "insisted", "admitted", "observed"], ["accepted", "expressed", "refused", "expected"], ["ordered", "revised", "booked", "fetched"], ["friend", "children", "wife", "boss"], ["Why", "When", "What", "How"], ["return", "lend", "keep", "give"], ["gift", "face", "heart", "hand"], ["take", "bring", "refuse", "receive"], ["connect", "share", "talk", "communicate"]], "answers": ["B", "C", "D", "B", "A", "C", "A", "B", "C", "C", "B", "A", "A", "C", "D", "C", "D", "D", "B"]}
