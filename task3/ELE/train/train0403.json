{"article": "\"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. \" --Albert Einstein It's no secret that curiosity makes learning more effective and _ . Curious students not only ask questions, but also _ seek out the answers. Without _ , Sir Isaac Newton would have never put forward the laws of physics, Alexander Fleming probably wouldn't have _ penicillin ,and Marie Curie's pioneering research on radioactivity may not exist. Curiosity is just as _ as intelligence in determining how well students do in school. Curiosity _ the brain for learning. As we all known, we're more likely to _ what we've learned when the subject matter interests us. Actually, curiosity also helpsus learn information wedon't consider _ or important. So if a teacher is able to _ students' curiosity, they'll be betterprepared to learn things that they would normally consider boring or difficult. For instance, if a student struggles with _ , personalizing math problem tomatch their specific interest could help them _ remember how to go about solving similar math problems in the future. However, scientists think that there arestill a few things that remain _ about curiosity's role in learning. For one thing, scientists have yet to determine its long-term effects. For instance, if a student's curiosity is aroused at the _ of a school day, will it help them better absorb information all day long? Another thing the _ are keen to investigate is why some people are more _ curious than others, and which factors most influence how curious we are.", "options": [["enjoyable", "impossible", "difficult", "avoidable"], ["lazily", "actively", "dependently", "negatively"], ["energy", "curiosity", "technology", "secret"], ["invented", "discovered", "heard", "learned"], ["important", "easy", "sensitive", "heavy"], ["blames", "searches", "begs", "prepares"], ["remember", "dislike", "forgive", "abandon"], ["interesting", "boring", "friendly", "awful"], ["arouse", "remove", "record", "miss"], ["physics", "chemistry", "math", "biology"], ["better", "less", "louder", "harder"], ["distinct", "unclear", "certain", "confident"], ["beginning", "end", "age", "time"], ["teachers", "students", "researchers", "police"], ["immediately", "indifferently", "naturally", "seriously"]], "answers": ["B", "B", "B", "B", "B", "D", "A", "A", "B", "C", "B", "B", "B", "C", "C"]}
