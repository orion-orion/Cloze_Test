{"article": "\"Why do we shout in anger?\" a saint asked his disciples . \"Why do people shout at each other when they are upset?\" His disciples thought for a while, and one of them said, \"Because we _ our calm, we shout for that.\" \"But, why do you shout when the other person is _ next to you?\" asked the saint. \"Isn't it possible to speak to him or her with a soft _ ? Why do you shout at a person when you're angry?\" Disciples gave some other answers but none _ the saint. Finally he explained, \"When two people are angry at each other, their _ distance a lot. To cover that distance they must shout to be able to hear each other. The angrier they are, the _ they will have to shout to hear each other through that great distance.\" Then the saint asked, \"What _ when two people fall in love? They don't shout at each other but talk softly, why? Because their hearts are very close and the distance between them is very _ .\" The saint continued, \"When they love each other even more, what happens? They do not speak loudly, only whisper and they get _ closer to each other in their love. Finally they even need not whisper, they only look at each other and that's all. That is how close two people are when they love each other.\" The saint said finally, \"When you argue, do not let your hearts get _ , and do not say words that distance each other more, or there will come a day when the distance is so great that you will not _ the path to return!\"", "options": [["miss", "lose", "avoid", "refuse"], ["already", "yet", "just", "well"], ["voice", "sound", "attitude", "manner"], ["excited", "satisfied", "surprised", "persuaded"], ["heads", "brains", "backs", "hearts"], ["faster", "slower", "louder", "earlier"], ["happens", "matters", "decides", "concerns"], ["short", "long", "easy", "hard"], ["never", "ever", "too", "even"], ["empty", "distant", "cold", "lonely"], ["build", "repair", "follow", "find"]], "answers": ["B", "C", "A", "B", "D", "C", "A", "A", "D", "B", "D"]}
