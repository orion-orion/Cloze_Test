{"article": "Have you ever imagined that you could be cloned like Dolly the sheep in the not too distant future? The news that a human embryo has been successfully cloned for the first time has caused mixed reactions. The _ was carried out by scientists from the Advanced Cell Technology Inc(ACT), in Massachusetts, US. The group made known the news on November 25. This is not a cloned human being. A clone is alive, it walks, it breathes, said Jamie Grifo, a(n) _ on the study of cloning at New York University School of Medicine. \"This is a set of cells in a lab that will be used to _ someone's life.\" Such research could lead to treatment for _ such as heart diseases, AIDS and even cancer, according to scientists. Despite high hopes from other scientists, the news raised concerns immediately from religious and political leaders. Several _ in the US do not allow human cloning. President George W. Bush also made it clear that he is against any type of human cloning. However, the scientists at ACT said they have no interest at present in _ an early embryo into a baby . Animals have been cloned repeatedly since Dolly the sheep appeared in 1997. And there were no real technical _ to stand in the way of scientists making a cloned human embryo. This time the research group used traditional cloning technology with a human _ . _ it was given DNA from an adult cell, the egg began to grow . _ it was stopped from becoming a baby--at a stage in which it was _ a ball of cells. The _ technology has been used to clone sheep, cattle and monkeys.", "options": [["research", "report", "works", "task"], ["worker", "head", "expert", "assistant"], ["save", "rescue", "cure", "treat"], ["patients", "health", "diseases", "things"], ["countries", "nations", "peoples", "states"], ["developing", "building", "inventing", "discovering"], ["questions", "affairs", "business", "problems"], ["egg", "bless", "meat", "cell"], ["Before", "After", "While", "And"], ["And", "But", "However", "Yet"], ["yet", "still", "not", "also"], ["different", "usual", "ordinary", "same"]], "answers": ["A", "C", "A", "C", "D", "A", "D", "A", "B", "B", "B", "D"]}
