{"article": "The measure of a man's real character is what he would do if he knew he would never be found out. ----Thomas Macaulay About thirty years ago, I was studying in a public school in New York. One day, Mrs Nanette O'Neill gave a maths 41 _ to our class. When the papers were _ she discovered that twelve boys had made exactly the _ mistakes throughout the test. There is nothing really new about 44 _ in exams. Perhaps that was _ Mrs O'Neill didn't even say a word about it. She only asked the twelve boys to _ after class. I was one of the twelve. Mrs O'Neill asked _ questions, and she didn't _ us either. Instead, she wrote on the blackboard the _ words by Thomas Macaulay. She then ordered us to copy these words into our exercise-books one hundred times. I don't know about the other eleven boys.

But all of us are called 56 _ daily to make a great many personal decisions. Should the wallet, 57 _ in the street, be put into a pocket or 58 turned over to the policeman?
