{"article": "It doesn't come as a surprise to you to _ that it makes no _ what you read or study if you can't remember it. You just _ your valuable time. Maybe you have already _ some clever ways to keep yourself from forgetting. One dependable aid that does help you remember what you study is to have a _ purpose or reason for reading. You remember better what you read when you know why you're reading. Why does a clerk in a store go away and _ you when your reply to her _ to help is \"No, thank you. I'm just looking?\" Both you and she know that if you aren't sure what you want, you are not _ to find it. But suppose you say _ , \"Yes, thank you. I want a pair of sun glasses.\" She says, \"Right this way, please.\" It's quite the same with your studying. If you choose a book at random, just looking for nothing in particular , you may end up with just that-nothing. But if you do know what you want, you are almost sure to get it. Your reasons will _ ; they will include reading or studying \"to find out more about\", \"to understand the reasons for\" and \"to find out how\". This is the way it _ . Before you start to study, you say to yourself _ like this. \"I'm reading this article to find out why Stephen Vincent Benet happened to write about America.\" Or, \"I'm going to skim this story to see what life was like in medieval England.\" Because you know  _ you are reading or studying, you _ the information to your purpose and remember it better. Reading is not one single activity. At least two important _ go on at the same time. As you read, you take in ideas rapidly and accurately. But at the same time you express your own ideas to yourself as you react to what you read. You have a kind of mental conversation with the author. If you expressed your ideas orally, they might sound like this: \"Yes, I agree. That's my opinion too.\" Or \"Ummm, I thought that sports record was _ much earlier. I'd better check that date,\" or \"But there are some other facts to be considered!\" You don't just sit there acquiring information; you are also _ between facts and opinions. Facts can be checked by evidence while opinions are one's own personal reactions.", "options": [["realize", "forget", "regret", "memorize"], ["mistake", "decision", "difference", "contribution"], ["seize", "save", "own", "waste"], ["remembered", "uncovered", "searched", "discovered"], ["general", "specific", "current", "permanent"], ["complain", "leave", "desert", "accompany"], ["invitation", "standard", "offer", "greeting"], ["possibly", "probable", "possible", "likely"], ["rather", "instead", "though", "therefore"], ["vary", "change", "measure", "distract"], ["affects", "works", "exists", "improves"], ["everything", "anything", "nothing", "something"], ["when", "how", "why", "where"], ["relate", "put", "contribute", "appoint"], ["principles", "experiments", "expectations", "processes"], ["lost", "broken", "setting", "appeared"], ["collecting", "digesting", "regulating", "distinguishing"]], "answers": ["A", "C", "D", "D", "B", "B", "C", "D", "B", "A", "B", "D", "C", "A", "D", "B", "D"]}
