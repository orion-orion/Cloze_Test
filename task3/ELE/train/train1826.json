{"article": "\"Efficiency is the by-product of comfort,\" says Dr. Erwin Tichauer of New York University. To prove this _ , Dr. Tichauer uses his capability to find _ ways to do things. For example , he felt that the traditional kind of pliers _ a better design. The usual _ limited hand movement and used unnecessary force because it bent the _ . So he designed a pair of pliers to allow the wrist to remain in a comfortable position. To improve the design of a tool and then make work easier, Dr. Tichauer _ the old tools. He asks such questions as: why _ a stepladder have four legs _ three are more stable? Why dose a screwdriver have to be made with straight handles? After testing his _ , he has invented a new tool that causes less muscle injury and is more efficient. Tichauer is not interested in getting _ from his inventions. In fact, he says, \"We _ people to steal from us. At New York University, we do not patent knowledge or invention.\" _ companies have adopted some of his inventions. As a biochemist, as well as inventor, Dr Techauer _ the effect of stress on areas of the body. Even easy _ work may put heavy stress on small areas of body and in time causes a serious disease. Thus his studies of workers in factories who use the _ tool all day long are extremely _ in learning about the damage on human body? Dr. Techauer knows that he can not redesign the _ so he redesigns the tool!", "options": [["argument", "impression", "statement", "expectation"], ["unusual", "easier", "new", "correct"], ["followed", "showed", "needed", "proved"], ["design", "habits", "materials", "work"], ["body", "finger", "hand", "wrist"], ["tests", "uses", "fixes", "destroys"], ["could", "will", "would", "must"], ["if", "because", "when", "once"], ["inventions", "theories", "tools", "questions"], ["recognized", "famous", "excited", "rich"], ["encourage", "prevent", "warn", "forgive"], ["Modern", "Research", "Commercial", "Industrial"], ["teaches", "studies", "produces", "discovers"], ["physical", "daily", "office", "research"], ["wrong", "old", "same", "heavy"], ["suitable", "valuable", "logical", "practical"], ["work", "study", "labor", "body"]], "answers": ["C", "B", "C", "A", "D", "A", "D", "C", "B", "D", "A", "C", "B", "A", "B", "B", "D"]}
