{"article": "My Forever Valentine\"\" Valentine's Day was the time my father chose to show his love for the special people in his life. Over the years I fondly thought _ him as my \"Valentine man\". My first recollection of the _ he could bring to Valentine's Day came when I was six. That morning at the breakfast table I found a card and a gift-wrapped package at my chair. The card was _ \"Love, Dad\" and the gift was a ring with a small piece of red glass to _ my birthstone, a ruby . There is _ difference between red glass and rubies to a child of six, and I remember _ that ring with pride that all the cards in the world _ not surpass .  _ I grew older, the gifts gave _ to heart-shaped boxes filled with my _ chocolate and always included a _ card signed \"Love, Dad\". In those years my thank-you became _ of a perfunctory response. The cards seemed less _ , and I took for granted that the Valentine would _ be there. I had _ my hopes and dreams in receiving cards and gifts from \"significant others\" and \"Love Dad\" just didn't seem quite _ . His final card remains on my desk today. It's a _ of how special fathers can be and how important it has been to me over the years to know that I had a father who continued a _ of love with simple acts of understanding and an ability to express happiness over the people in his life. Those things never _ , nor does the memory of a man who never _ being my Valentine.", "options": [["of", "about", "up", "over"], ["memory", "magic", "puzzle", "presents"], ["read", "written", "shown", "signed"], ["recover", "resemble", "represent", "replace"], ["much", "little", "great", "less"], ["having", "owning", "wearing", "watching"], ["could", "did", "must", "should"], ["Because", "Since", "When", "As"], ["room", "way", "honour", "seat"], ["favorite", "lovely", "dear", "precious"], ["usual", "common", "strange", "special"], ["less", "little", "more", "much"], ["important", "beautiful", "familiar", "standard"], ["surely", "always", "regularly", "often"], ["let", "kept", "placed", "remembered"], ["suitable", "enough", "effective", "sacred"], ["signal", "certificate", "consequence", "reminder"], ["tradition", "hobby", "habit", "custom"], ["lose", "die", "miss", "appear"], ["thought", "wanted", "tried", "stopped"]], "answers": ["A", "B", "D", "C", "B", "C", "A", "D", "B", "A", "D", "C", "A", "B", "C", "B", "D", "A", "B", "D"]}
