{"article": "Before discussing different kinds of emotions, let us briefly talk about how researchers _ bodily processes, actions and behavior, and how this relates to what we do in our daily lives when we observe emotions in others . Bodily processes can be directly measured by _ of a polygraph. When a polygraph is skillfully used to _ how we react bodily with what we are _ , it is called a \"lie detector\". Bodily processes can also be measured _ . This is what we do when we observe someone blushing . However, we are not always _ of what bodily processes respond to. Measuring action _ behavior is the other way researchers assess the emotions. For example , one measure of fear of snakes is how _ a person will go to the snake. Another procedure is to have a person _ how afraid he is, or how he feels, in this way, researchers have _ the so-called \"fear thermometer\" to assess a person's fear. _ our everyday living, we do very much the same thing. Only not too _ . We react to what a person does, what he says, _ he says it, and how he looks. Is he smiling? Is his voice trembling? We put all this _ together to infer what a person is feeling. _ , we do not always act as we feel. Sometimes we do things that we don't feel like doing. _ we say we feel one way and then we act another. Actors, for example, successfully learn to \"make believe\" emotions, or learn to _ them. Thus we _ always tell what a person is feeling by what he says or by what he does.", "options": [["measure", "describe", "make", "use"], ["ways", "methods", "means", "tools"], ["combine", "treat", "examine", "compare"], ["doing", "saying", "observing", "carrying"], ["directly", "indirectly", "easily", "difficultly"], ["afraid", "fond", "aware", "accused"], ["but", "so", "and", "or"], ["slow", "fast", "far", "close"], ["tell", "say", "talk", "speak"], ["approved", "discovered", "developed", "informed"], ["During", "With", "On", "In"], ["skillfully", "systematically", "naturally", "eventually"], ["why", "where", "how", "whether"], ["imaginations", "observations", "impressions", "awareness"], ["Therefore", "Otherwise", "However", "Anyway"], ["Sometime", "Someway", "Sometimes", "Anytime"], ["express", "hide", "act", "say"], ["needn't", "shan't", "won't", "Can't"]], "answers": ["A", "C", "D", "B", "B", "C", "D", "D", "A", "C", "D", "B", "C", "B", "C", "C", "B", "D"]}
