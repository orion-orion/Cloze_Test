{"article": "A few years ago, my younger brother and I went to Norfolk, Virginian by plane. _ , before we took off, we heard the pilot's voice throughout the plane, \"Sorry, ladies and gentlemen. We have no _ on the plane. We have a generator , and we are going to _ the engines with it. We will get up in the air and head to Norfolk, and see what happens. \" See what happens? We are going to get up in the air, and see what happens? At this point, one woman started crying. \"Oh, no! We are going to _ !\" There were sighs of _ and anxiety quickly spreading throughout the plane, and we hadn't even taken off yet. Thirty minutes passed and we were still _ there. Then the voice of the pilot came over again,\" Ladies and gentlemen, I know you are _ , so are we. We only have one engine going right now, and it is working double time.\" There was crying as if we had walked in to grave . But the pilot told us our one engine was working double time, and his _ was to get up in the air and see what happens! Then we did. We got up in the air and _ happened. We arrived in Norfolk and everyone _ for still being alive. Although I do sincerely like to have a plan better than \"see what happens\", it really isn't such a bad life strategy. All too often, I would see people pursuing their goals _ with inaction just because they don't have _ success. Actually, success will never be guaranteed. The _ thing that you can do is just get up in the air, and see what happens. If you are planning to learn a new skill, \"get up in the air, and see what happens!\" It might not be as _ as you thought. You might be smarter than you thought, and the result could be very _ ! So don't stay there trying nothing just because there is no _ of guaranteed success.", "options": [["Hopefully", "Excitedly", "Unfortunately", "Thankfully"], ["service", "power", "water", "fuel"], ["shut", "fix", "change", "start"], ["wait", "delay", "crash", "suffer"], ["rumor", "desperation", "disease", "pain"], ["sitting", "checking", "watching", "boarding"], ["puzzled", "patient", "anxious", "embarrassed"], ["comment", "complaint", "promise", "plan"], ["everything", "something", "nothing", "anything"], ["escaped", "cheered", "sighed", "praised"], ["frozen", "annoyed", "concerned", "satisfied"], ["realistic", "organized", "potential", "guaranteed"], ["same", "common", "best", "last"], ["interesting", "challenging", "surprising", "encouraging"], ["rewarding", "disappointing", "sorrow", "trouble"], ["meaning", "sign", "action", "reward"]], "answers": ["C", "B", "D", "C", "B", "A", "C", "D", "C", "B", "A", "D", "C", "B", "A", "B"]}
