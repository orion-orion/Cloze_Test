{"article": "The measure of a man's real character is what he would do if he knew he would never be found out.         --Thomas Macaulay  Some thirty years ago, I was studying in a public school in New York. One day, Mrs. Nanette O'Neill gave an arithmetic _ to our class. When the papers were marked she discovered that twelve boys had made exactly the _ mistakes throughout the test.  There is nothing really new about43 _ in exams. Perhaps that was why Mrs. O'Neill _ even say a word about it. She only asked the twelve boys to _ after class. I was one of the twelve.  Mrs. O'Neill asked _ questions, and she didn't _ us either. Instead, she wrote on the blackboard the _ words by Thomas Macaulay. She then ordered us to _ these words into our exercise-books one hundred times.  I don't _ about the other eleven boys. Speaking for _ I can say :it was the most important single _ of my life. Thirty years after being introduced to Macaulay's words, they _ seem to me the best yardstick , because they give us a _ to measure ourselves rather than others.   _ of us are asked to make _ decisions about nations going to war or armies going to battle. But all of us are called upon daily to make a great many personal decisions.57 _ the wallet, found in the street, be put into a pocket _ turned over to the policeman? Should the _ change received at the store be forgotten or returned? Nobody will know except _ . But you have to live with yourself, and it is always better to live with someone you respect.", "options": [["paper", "problem", "test", "lesson"], ["easy", "funny", "same", "serious"], ["lying", "cheating", "guessing", "discussing"], ["didn't", "did", "would", "wouldn't"], ["come", "leave", "apologize", "remain"], ["no", "certain", "many", "more"], ["excuse", "reject", "help", "scold"], ["following", "common", "above", "unusual"], ["repeat", "copy", "put", "get"], ["worry", "know", "hear", "talk"], ["myself", "ourselves", "themselves", "herself"], ["chance", "incident", "lesson", "memory"], ["even", "almost", "always", "still"], ["way", "sentence", "choice", "reason"], ["All", "Few", "Some", "None"], ["quick", "wise", "great", "personal"], ["Would", "Must", "Should", "Need"], ["and", "or", "then", "but"], ["extra", "small", "some", "necessary"], ["me", "us", "you", "them"]], "answers": ["C", "A", "B", "D", "C", "A", "C", "D", "A", "D", "C", "A", "D", "B", "C", "A", "B", "C", "B", "D"]}
