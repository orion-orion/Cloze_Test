{"article": "Once upon a time, two brothers, who lived on neighboring farms, fell into conflict. It was the first serious 31 _ in their 40 years' brotherhood. Then one day the long tie fell apart . It resulted from a small misunderstanding, and then grew into a major difference, and eventually exploded into an exchange of _ words followed by weeks of silence.  Very early one morning there was a(n) _ on the elder brother's door. He opened it to find a man with a carpenter's toolbox. \"I'm _ for a few days' work,\" he said. \"Perhaps you would have a few small jobs here and there. Could I help you?\"  \"Well as it happens there is,\" said the elder brother, _ across the creek to his brother's farm. \"My younger brother lives there. A conflict broke out between us and he used his bulldozer to dig the creek to _ me and thus a gap _ between us. And I'll do something to _ him back. See that pile of wood over there? I want you to build me a 3-metre-high fence, so I won't need to see him or his place anymore.\" The carpenter said, \"I think I understand the _ . Show me the nails and the digger and I'll be able to do a job that _ you.\" The elder brother had to go to town for supplies, so he helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was _ for the day. About sunset _ the elder brother returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. Much to the elder brother's shock: there was no _ there at all; instead there was a bridge, _ from one side of the creek to the other. And his younger brother was coming across the bridge. \"You are quite a fellow to build this bridge regardless of all I've said and done,\" he said. The two brothers then met in the middle of the bridge, taking each other's hand and _ . They then turned to see the carpenter _ his toolbox on his shoulder. \"No, wait, please 49 _ a few days. I've a lot of other projects for you,\" said the older brother. \"I'd love to stay on,\" the carpenter said, \"but I have many more _ to build.\"", "options": [["distance", "gap", "routine", "regret"], ["bitter", "acute", "absurd", "genuine"], ["response", "remark", "delivery", "knock"], ["arranging", "qualifying", "hunting", "accounting"], ["walking", "leading", "expanding", "pointing"], ["resist", "annoy", "advocate", "concern"], ["fills", "narrows", "exists", "deposits"], ["call", "hold", "bring", "pay"], ["situation", "trend", "duty", "practice"], ["strikes", "attracts", "satisfies", "frustrates"], ["around", "off", "over", "back"], ["when", "until", "while", "since"], ["room", "fence", "toolbox", "farm"], ["wandering", "ranging", "transporting", "stretching"], ["trembled", "embraced", "fought", "swore"], ["remove", "spread", "display", "raise"], ["play", "wander", "stay", "enjoy"], ["bridges", "farms", "houses", "fences"]], "answers": ["B", "A", "D", "C", "D", "B", "C", "D", "A", "C", "B", "A", "B", "D", "B", "D", "C", "A"]}
