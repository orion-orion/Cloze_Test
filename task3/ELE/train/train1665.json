{"article": "I recently heard a story about a famous scientist who had made several very important medical breakthroughs . He was being interviewed by a reporter who asked him _ he thought he was able to be so much more _ than the average person. He responded that it all came from a(n) _ with his mother that occurred when he was about 2. He had been trying to _ milk from the fridge when he _ the slippery bottle, its contents running all over the kitchen floor. When his mother came in, instead of shouting at him or giving him a lecture, she said, \"Robert, what a great and wonderful _ you have made! I have _ seen such a huge pool of milk. Well, the damage has already been _ . Would you like to get down and _ in the milk for a few minutes before we clean it up?\" Indeed, he did. After a few minutes, his mother said, \"Robert, whenever you make a mess like this, eventually you have to restore everything to its proper order. So, how would you like to do that? We could use a sponge , a towel or a mop. Which do you prefer?\" He chose the sponge. His mother then said, \" You know, what we have here is a _ experiment in how to effectively carry a big milk bottle with two _ hands. Let's go out in the back yard and fill the bottle with water and see if you can make it .\" The little boy learned that if he _ the bottle at the top near the lip with both hands, he could carry it without dropping it. What a wonderful _ ! This scientist then said that it was at that moment that he knew he didn't need to be _ to make mistakes. Instead, he learned that mistakes were just _ for learning something new, which is, after all , what scientific experiments are all about. Even if the experiment \"doesn't _ ,\" we usually learn something _ from it.", "options": [["why", "what", "when", "how"], ["capable", "able", "creative", "original"], ["coincidence", "experience", "incident", "conflict"], ["carry", "bring", "remove", "fetch"], ["fell", "lost", "escaped", "dropped"], ["picture", "mass", "map", "mess"], ["rarely", "happily", "frequently", "angrily"], ["got", "suffered", "done", "received"], ["jump", "play", "enjoy", "lay"], ["failed", "successful", "fantastic", "painful"], ["strong", "tiny", "thin", "weak"], ["controlled", "possessed", "occupied", "grasped"], ["example", "teaching", "lesson", "instruction"], ["anxious", "nervous", "fearful", "afraid"], ["situations", "opportunities", "occasions", "turns"], ["do", "finish", "go", "work"], ["worthy", "costly", "valuable", "interesting"]], "answers": ["A", "C", "B", "C", "D", "A", "A", "C", "B", "A", "B", "D", "C", "D", "B", "D", "C"]}
