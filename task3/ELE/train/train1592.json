Because criticisms are always centered on ourselves. When we criticize others, we do not expose them, but expose ourselves. We _ our own weakness and smallness. A story in the old tales _ the difference in wisdom between the good and the bad. Once a king meets with both Nelson and Dick. The king asks Nelson to go out into the kingdom and _ after finding someone less qualified than himself. Then he asks Dick to go out into the kingdom and return after finding someone _ than himself. When Fool Dick returns, he tells the king that he couldn't find anyone better than himself. _ Wise Nelson says that he was _ to find anyone less qualified than himself on his return. Moral of the story is something about human _ . Good people always look at their own _ and faults and consider themselves less qualified than others.
