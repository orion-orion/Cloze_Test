{"article": "Having been a music teacher for twenty-seven years, I have always known that music touches the spirit. It can break through all kinds of barriers to reach the students in a very special way. It can be the _ by which each child can find their light. I'd like to share a story where music overcame a _ barrier and made a connection with a young student. One of my most _ students was a young girl called Vanessa. Vanessa had difficulty walking and couldn't speak at that time. We _ sat on the floor for our music lessons. We all like a song, which was a call and response song where I sang the call and the students clapped twice while singing the repeat, \"Oh, yes!\" We probably _ that song during every class, Vanessa and I clapping together. She never said or sang a word. One day late in the school year, when the song was finished, Vanessa turned around, looked at me directly in the eye, clapped her tiny hands twice and _ the words \"Oh, yes!\" I opened my mouth in surprise and for that moment I was the one who couldn't speak . Through music, we had made an excellent _ . Several years later, I met Vanessa in the street in town. She waved to me with a big smile on her face and then clapped her hands twice, copying the song we had performed so many times. This precious little girl, _ her connection with music, left a(n) _ on me that will last forever. Every child has the ability to learn and grow. It is up to us as _ to discover the way to reach each and every one of our students. We all must find each child's light.", "options": [["goal", "means", "course", "experience"], ["physical", "mental", "potential", "musical"], ["favorite", "unforgettable", "active", "serious"], ["usually", "actually", "hardly", "Final"], ["recorded", "performed", "composed", "heard"], ["signed", "read", "wrote", "said"], ["connection", "choice", "comment", "promise"], ["towards", "beyond", "through", "for"], ["impression", "voice", "mark", "message"], ["artists", "educators", "doctors", "researchers"]], "answers": ["B", "A", "B", "A", "B", "D", "A", "C", "A", "B"]}
