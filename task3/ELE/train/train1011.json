{"article": "A Slice of Generosity It was Saturday and we decided to take our kids for _ out. We chose a branch of Pizza Express at the Surbiton Street. We entered the restaurant and sat down _ an empty table. There was an elderly lady dining alone at the next table. It was clear that the lady had _ needs. After some time, she finished her eating, sat up and went to the _ to pay the bill. The waitress tried her bank card several times but couldn't make it. Then the waitress turned to her and _ told the lady that there was something wrong with her bank card and it couldn't be used at that moment. The lady looked _ and confused, not knowing what to do. The kind and patient waitress told her not to be nervous and that she could call her _ for help. Hearing that word, Jeremy, my husband, _ sat up and told the waiting staff that we would pay for the lady's meal. The waitress smiled to us approvingly and said OK. My husband went to her and handed her our bank card. However, just at that moment, the manager arrived. He learned about the matter and turned to the lady, saying that _ she couldn't use her bank card to pay, there was no need to worry because Pizza Express had allowed the restaurant to give away two _ meals every month and on this occasion, they would like to _ her with a free meal. She was extremely _ and apologetic that she had been unable to pay. We were _ that the lady had been _ in such a respectful way and that she was not placed in a difficult and embarrassing position. Then, the manager turned and headed to us. He said that, as we had shown such _ and helpfulness, he would like to _ the second free meal that the restaurant was able to offer to us! We were extremely surprised! I have never heard of any chain restaurant behaving in such a _ way. We were quite impressed with gratitude, expressing our _ to the manager on behalf of both the lady and us. I made sure that the lady was able to get home OK then we thanked the staff and manager again and left the restaurant. I think Pizza Express, and in particular the manager of the Surbiton branch, _ our praise and respect. I told the manager that my younger son also had special needs and that I really _ the way the restaurant had treated this special case. Everyone may come across something unpredictable and if we can act just like the manager in the Pizza Express, then the world will become a better one.", "options": [["fun", "music", "play", "dinner"], ["in", "behind", "at", "on"], ["special", "ordinary", "extraordinary", "particular"], ["kitchen", "counter", "restaurant", "bank"], ["proudly", "impatiently", "hurriedly", "politely"], ["satisfied", "embarrassed", "pleased", "unfriendly"], ["manager", "chef", "husband", "father"], ["excitedly", "gradually", "immediately", "happily"], ["since", "for", "as", "though"], ["free", "ordinary", "regular", "cheap"], ["provide", "fill", "equip", "furnish"], ["satisfied", "disappointed", "grateful", "sympathetic"], ["interested", "worried", "stressed", "relieved"], ["criticized", "treated", "accepted", "recognized"], ["modesty", "curiosity", "generosity", "honesty"], ["deliver", "show", "sell", "donate"], ["generous", "silly", "sensitive", "selfish"], ["satisfaction", "disappointment", "thanks", "regret"], ["receives", "deserves", "needs", "wants"], ["disapproved", "appreciated", "forgave", "disliked"]], "answers": ["D", "C", "A", "B", "D", "B", "A", "C", "D", "A", "A", "C", "D", "B", "C", "D", "A", "C", "B", "B"]}
