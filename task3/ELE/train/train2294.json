{"article": "From my second year of primary school on, there was one event I dreaded every year: the piano recital . A recital meant I had to practice a _ piece of music and perform in front of strangers who knew the _ much better than I. Each year I would ask my father if I could skip the recital \"just this once\". And he _ say something about building self-confidence and working toward a goal. So it was with great satisfaction that I stood in church one recent Sunday, and watched my father _ in his shirt and tie before rising to play the piano in his very first recital. My father had _ to play music when he was small. But his mother couldn't afford lessons. A _ couple helped him, but he soon _ after being teased by other boys. Three years ago, when he retired he asked his church music director, Charles Staples, to take him as a/an _ . One recent Sunday just before the recital, he told me my dad was playing \"the best I've ever seen him. I keep waiting for him to reach his _ , but he hasn't yet.\" For a moment _ my father sat down at the keyboard to play, he simply stared _ at his fingers, and I wondered whether he would even begin. He's forgotten the notes, I worried, remembering those moments decades ago when my mind would go _ and my fingers would _ . But then Aram Khachaturian's melody came, and I realized he has been doing what music teachers always tell their new students to do: focus on the music and _ the rest of us aren't there. My dad _ it through Melody and then through another one. What he lacked in skill, he more than made up for in feeling. He rose, turned to his audience and bowed, making us laugh _ relief and affection . Also in the audience was my 11-year-old son Jeff. \"So what did you think about your granddad?\" I asked Jeff later. \"He was great,\" Jeff replied. \"I'm proud of him for starting something new at his age,\" I said. \"Yeah, and doing it so well,\" Jeff added. My father may not have reached his peak _ , but as far as his grandson is concerned, he's at the top of the mountain.", "options": [["sweet", "bright", "boring", "sad"], ["profession", "notes", "recital", "event"], ["would", "should", "could", "might"], ["wearing", "sweating", "gathering", "switching"], ["longed", "learned", "managed", "started"], ["senior", "rough", "gifted", "kindly"], ["started", "stopped", "enjoyed", "progressed"], ["student", "teacher", "player", "assistant"], ["goal", "aim", "peak", "standard"], ["after", "while", "since", "as"], ["away", "down", "out", "through"], ["mad", "wild", "blank", "cool"], ["move", "apply", "slide", "freeze"], ["ignore", "pretend", "guess", "announce"], ["made", "got", "reached", "played"], ["with", "at", "from", "by"], ["purposely", "thoroughly", "musically", "originally"]], "answers": ["C", "B", "A", "B", "A", "D", "B", "A", "C", "A", "B", "C", "D", "B", "A", "A", "C"]}
