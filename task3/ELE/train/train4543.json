{"article": "\"When we feel love and kindness toward others, it not only makes others feel loved and cared for, but it helps us also to develop inner happiness and peace.\" As we live through life, we tend to get caught up in our individual world, our problems -- our life. When we _ our world to include others in a meaningful way, by making a _ difference in their life, we increase our experience at the same time. Think back on a time when someone made a difference in your life. Here is one of mine: I was going to college, working part-time, and just _ getting by financially. Standing in line at a local supermarket, I _ a woman in the same line, thinking that she was not very attractive. As I was checking out , I discovered that I did not have enough money to pay; without _ , that same woman I had been judging offered to make up the difference. It wasn't _ , but what that person did made a lasting impression on me. She was a beautiful, caring soul who was willing to help a stranger in a(an) _ situation. That happened over forty years ago and I remember it as _ as if it was yesterday. Other examples are the numerous times I have had people smile at me, which _ my day. I've often wondered if it was because I was smiling, which I _ to do all the time, or because they were smiling to be _ , which encouraged me to smile as well. It has probably been some of both. In _ case, that simple gesture (a smile) makes a difference in my day. There are _ ways to make a significant difference in another's life. The question is: Are we doing it? It does not _ anything, but it does require some effort on our part. I have found that as I do this consistently, the _ go far beyond the energy required to do the deed. Looking for ways to brighten another person's day raises our vibration ,and when we act on it, we _ the other person to raise their vibration as well -- it is _ to each other. Make a difference in someone's life today, and _ doing so every day. Today is a perfect time to start! If you are already doing so. bravo!", "options": [["rebuild", "establish", "expand", "develop"], ["direct", "minor", "remarkable", "positive"], ["thoroughly", "smoothly", "barely", "actually"], ["observed", "witnessed", "inspected", "accompanied"], ["expectation", "hesitation", "assumption", "intention"], ["much", "enough", "little", "awful"], ["urgent", "absurd", "hopeless", "embarrassing"], ["roughly", "clearly", "correctly", "dimly"], ["brightens", "ruins", "begins", "influences"], ["undertook", "tried", "promised", "failed"], ["dynamic", "appealing", "friendly", "merciful"], ["neither", "either", "no", "another"], ["limited", "vital", "necessary", "countless"], ["deserve", "charge", "determine", "cost"], ["efforts", "achievements", "returns", "consequences"], ["assist", "remind", "permit", "persuade"], ["similar", "beneficial", "fundamental", "appropriate"], ["admit", "prefer", "recommend", "consider"]], "answers": ["C", "D", "C", "A", "B", "A", "D", "B", "A", "B", "C", "B", "D", "D", "C", "A", "B", "D"]}
