{"article": "I was sitting at the bar of a local restaurant having lunch 0 and taking a break. A pretty girl who looked about 25 walked in and sat down in a booth _ for her friend. It didn't take long _ I saw she was trying to stay _ from other people's gazes and my heart sank. You could see her hair was falling out and, at such a young age, she was receiving chemo . I sat there watching her trying to remain composed and she was having a _ time of it. I _ for her, imagining what it must be like to go through this and yet I know some of her _ . You see I _ my wife, the love of my life just a few short years ago and watched her slowly fade away. I needed to give a message of _ to this girl. But how? What could I do? Then it _ to me! I called over her waitress and explained that I wanted to buy the girl and her friend's lunch but I also told her not to tell her it was me. I also _ the waitress a note to give to the girl. The note _ as follows: \" Someone today thought you were beautiful; someone today thought your smile glowed _ excitement; someone today thought your eyes _ up the world; someone today cared and wanted you to know this. Enjoy the rest of your day, pretty young lady.\" About 15 minutes later, the young girl asked for her _ and I watched as she was told it was paid for. She asked why? Who? What for? The waitress simply handed her the note and _ to her the gentleman who did it left. I watched as she slowly read the note. Her eyes tore up, for only a moment, and then came the smile! A huge, beautiful, hopeful smile! She lit up the room and then sat up straight, not _ who saw her. It's not _ we look or what we have; it's not our houses or how many cars we have; nor is it how much money we can earn. It's all about how much we care and what we do, even though it's making someone feel pretty only for a moment.", "options": [["searching", "hoping", "looking", "waiting"], ["so", "before", "after", "until"], ["hidden", "stubborn", "focused", "sighted"], ["easy", "good", "tough", "great"], ["sank", "ached", "trust", "puzzled"], ["idea", "view", "trouble", "pain"], ["left", "deserted", "buried", "valued"], ["dream", "hope", "energy", "wish"], ["struck", "happened", "occurred", "hit"], ["handed", "presented", "provided", "brought"], ["told", "spoke", "read", "wrote"], ["for", "on", "of", "with"], ["tore", "lit", "cheered", "lifted"], ["bill", "meal", "check", "share"], ["explained", "informed", "warned", "reminded"], ["knowing", "ignoring", "risking", "caring"], ["what", "when", "why", "how"]], "answers": ["D", "B", "A", "C", "B", "D", "C", "B", "C", "A", "C", "D", "B", "A", "A", "D", "D"]}
