You only have to share your children's interests. Firstly, listen to their questions. I once _ a classroom of seven-year-olds to talk about science as a job. The children asked me \"textbook questions\" about schooling, salary and my job.

When teachers _ their \"wait time\" to three seconds or more, children usually give better answers. Thirdly, watch your language. When children are having a science discussion, don't jump in with \"That's right\" or \"Very good\" because these _ may make the children think that discussion is over. Instead , keep things going by saying, \"I'd never thought of it that way before\", or coming up with more questions or ideas. Never _ a child to \"think\".
