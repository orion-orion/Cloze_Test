{"article": "My sons and I decided to go walking around the lake near our home the other day. It is such a _ place to spend an afternoon in the springtime when flowers are coming out on the trees and grass is coming up through the ground. It has a well _ path that circles the entire lake. You can walk at your own _ and delight in all the natural beauty that surrounds you. It is the perfect place to get back to _ nature and to fill your soul with joy. The only _ is that with the path being so near the water, erosion sometimes creates holes. It was while we were _ to walk along it the other day that one of them caught my oldest boy _ . He stumbled and almost fell but thankfully was able to reach out and take my hand. I _ him and we walked on for a while holding hands and feeling _ in our love for each other.

It is good to know, _ that we can always reach out and take the hands of our beloved ones. They are always there by our side _ to pick us up and steady us. They are always _ for us to take their hands and walk on with them connected in love without _ . The next time you stumble and fall on your _ through life then reach out and take loving hands. And _ you take them never let them go again. Walk on with them forever, choosing love and sharing joy with each _ you take. Always remember too that with the loving hands _ your walk you can use your other hands to reach out and help those who have fallen as well.
