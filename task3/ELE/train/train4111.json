{"article": "Eighty-year-old retired tailor, James McKay, spent Saturday night in jail after _ thirty-year-old Keith Smith over the head _ his walking stick. McKay's wife, Laurence told us that while McKay is usually a _ person, he had been _ to this act of violence by getting wet just once too often. Smith lives above the McKays and it appears that not only is he a keen gardener, he is also a _ collector. Unfortunately for him, the water he sent over his balcony every day ended up on the McKay's, or too often, on the McKays _ . \"For the last fortnight, since Smith moved into the flat above us, we have hardly dared to go to our _ ,\" said Laurence. She added that it wasn't so much the water falling onto their balcony from Smith watering his plant _ bothered them, it was more the way he cleaned his fish tanks. \"We'd be _ there happily reading our newspapers, when _ so much water would come from above that we'd be as wet as if we'd _ with our clothes on! Neither could we get rid of the _ of fish!\" And on Saturday evening it was just too _ . \"It was James's birthday,\" explained Laurence, \"and I'd made him a birthday cake. The candles were a great sight as you can imagine, but James didn't get to blow them out.\" _ Smith emptied one of his larger tanks over his balcony and both the McKays and the cake were wet _ . Rarely had Laurence seen McKay move so fast. \"I couldn't _ him. He was up there in a flash. It was the fastest I'd seen him move since 1964.\" Smith is not going to take things further with the police. He has also promised to change his _ from now on. And what of James McKay? _ he left the police station, a large crowd of supporters sang him, \"Happy Birthday\". \" _ the most exciting birthday _ !\" said the cheerful old man. \"The best since my adolescence I'd say!\"", "options": [["hitting", "tapping", "pushing", "touching"], ["by", "via", "through", "with"], ["quiet", "peaceful", "sensitive", "stubborn"], ["Accustomed", "taken", "driven", "attracted"], ["fish", "seed", "plant", "newspaper"], ["himself", "itself", "themselves", "herself"], ["Bathroom", "kitchen", "bedroom", "balcony"], ["which", "what", "that", "whether"], ["sitting", "exercising", "sleeping", "eating"], ["Regularly", "Unconsciously", "precisely", "suddenly"], ["swum", "showered", "watered", "drowned"], ["taste", "sense", "feeling", "smell"], ["little", "soon", "late", "much"], ["Beside", "Instead", "Otherwise", "Consequently"], ["over", "across", "through", "down"], ["stop", "blame", "ignore", "stand"], ["views", "attitude", "ways", "mind"], ["While", "Since", "Until", "As"], ["Sincerely", "Impossibly", "Definitely", "Previously"], ["Before", "ever", "already", "Since"]], "answers": ["A", "D", "B", "C", "A", "C", "D", "C", "A", "D", "B", "D", "D", "B", "C", "A", "C", "D", "C", "B"]}
