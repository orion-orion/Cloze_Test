{"article": "Another person's enthusiasm was what set me moving toward the success I have achieved. That person was my stepmother. I was nine years old when she entered our home in rural Virginia. My father _ me to her with these words: I would like you to meet the fellow who is _ for being the worst boy in this county and will probably start throwing rocks at you no _ than tomorrow morning. My stepmother walked over to me, _ my head slightly upward, and looked me right in the eye. Then she looked at my father and replied, You are _ .This is not the worst boy at all, _ the smartest one who hasn't yet found an outlet for his enthusiasm. That statement began a(n) _ between us. No one had ever called me smart, My family and neighbors had built me up in my _ as a bad boy. My stepmother changed all that. She changed many things. She _ my father to go to a dental school, from which he graduated with honors. She moved our family into the county seat, where my father's career could be more _ and my brother and I could be better _ . When I turned fourteen, she bought me a secondhand _ and told me that she believed that I could become a writer. I knew her ernthusiasm,I _ it had already improved our lives. I accepted her _ and began to write for local newspapers. I was doing the same kind of _ that great day I went to interview Andrew Carnegie and received the task which became my life's work later. I wasn't the _ beneficiary .My father became the _ man in town. My brother and stepbrothers became a physician, a dentist, a lawyer, and a college president. What power _ has! When that power is released to support the certainty of one's purpose and is _ strengthened by faith, it becomes an irresistible force which poverty and temporary defeat can never _ .

This is probably the greatest work you can do with your enthusiasm.", "options": [["rushed", "sent", "carried", "introduced"], ["distinguished", "favored", "mistaken", "rewarded"], ["sooner", "later", "longer", "earlier"], ["dragged", "shook", "raised", "bent"], ["perfect", "right", "wrong", "impolite"], ["but", "so", "and", "or"], ["agreement", "friendship", "gap", "relationship"], ["opinion", "image", "expectation", "mind"], ["begged", "persuaded", "ordered", "invited"], ["successful", "meaningful", "helpful", "useful"], ["treated", "entertained", "educated", "respected"], ["camera", "radio", "bicycle", "typewriter"], ["considered", "suspected", "ignored", "appreciated"], ["belief", "request", "criticism", "description"], ["teaching", "writing", "studying", "reading"], ["next", "same", "only", "real"], ["cleverest", "wealthiest", "strongest", "healthiest"], ["enthusiasm", "sympathy", "fortune", "confidence"], ["deliberately", "happily", "traditionally", "constantly"], ["win", "match", "reach", "doubt"]], "answers": ["D", "A", "B", "C", "C", "A", "B", "D", "B", "A", "C", "D", "D", "A", "B", "C", "B", "A", "D", "B"]}
