{"article": "It's difficult for doctors to help a person with a hurt brain. Without enough blood, the brain can live only 3 to 5 minutes. Usually doctors can't fix the hurt _ such a short time. Dr Robert White thinks he knows a _ of help. He thinks doctors should make the hurt brain cool enough to live for 30 minutes without blood. This gives the doctor a longer time to do something for the brain. Dr White experimented his _ on fifteen monkeys. _ he taught them to do different jobs. Then he operated on them. He made the monkeys' blood go _ a machine. When the brains' _ was 10degC,he stopped the blood to the brain. After 30 minutes, he turned the blood back on. He _ the blood again. After their operations, the monkeys were almost the same as before. They were healthy and busy. Each one could still do the job the doctor had taught them. Dr White's idea works well on monkeys. He thinks it will work on human beings . He thinks it will help with heart problems. A person doesn't have to die when his heart stops; doctors can _ it again. The problem comes: when the brain is without blood for about 5 minutes, it _ . If doctors start the heart again after 5 minutes, the person has a living body but a dead brain. Maybe in the future, doctors will _ Dr White's idea. When the person's heart stops, the doctor will _ cool the brain. They will have 30 minutes to start the heart again. Maybe there will be no problem with the brain.", "options": [["for", "after", "in", "since"], ["way", "brain", "doctor", "man"], ["medicine", "manners", "idea", "brain"], ["Besides", "Instead", "However", "First"], ["to", "across", "through", "onto"], ["heat", "temperature", "coolness", "feeling"], ["cooled", "operated", "warmed", "stopped"], ["start", "take", "make", "begin"], ["loses", "goes", "kills", "dies"], ["get", "accept", "keep", "try"], ["soon", "quickly", "slowly", "rapid"]], "answers": ["C", "A", "C", "D", "C", "B", "C", "A", "D", "D", "B"]}
