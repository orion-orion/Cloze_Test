{"article": "In ancient Egypt, the pharaoh treated the poor message runner like a prince when he arrived at the palace, if he brought good news. However, if the exhausted runner had the misfortune to bring the pharaoh unhappy news, his _ was cut off. Shades of that spirit spread over today's conversations. Once a friend and I _ up some peanut butter and sandwiches for an outing. We were walking light heartedly out the door, picnic basket in hand, _ a _ neighbor looked up at the sky and said, \"Oh boy, _ day for a picnic. The weatherman says it's going to rain.\" I wanted to _ him on the face with the peanut butter and sandwiches. Not for his stupid weather report, for his smile. Several months ago I was _ to catch a bus. As I put my handful of cash across the Greyhound counter _ , the sales agent said with a broad smile, \"Oh that bus _ five minutes ago. \" Dreams of head-cutting! It's not the _ that makes someone angry, _ it's the unsympathetic attitude with which it's delivered. Everyone must _ bad news from time to time, and winning professionals do it with the proper _ . A doctor advising a patient that she need an operation does it in a caring way. A boss _ an employee he didn't get the job _ a sympathetic tone. Big winners know, when delivering any bad news, they should share the feeling of the receiver. Unfortunately, many people are not _ of this. When youare tired _ a long flight, has a hotel clerk _ said that your room isn't ready yet? It makes you as _ want to land your fist right on their unsympathetic faces. Had my neighbor told me of the upcoming _ with sympathy, I would have appreciated his warming. Big winners, when they bear bad news, deliver bombs with the emotion the bombarded person is sure to have.", "options": [["head", "arm", "leg", "hand"], ["packed", "picked", "made", "turned"], ["while", "when", "as", "though"], ["friendly", "warm-hearted", "smiling", "considerate"], ["worried", "bad", "lucky", "good"], ["stick", "touch", "kiss", "strike"], ["racing", "walking", "moving", "skipping"], ["hopefully", "breathlessly", "helplessly", "thoughtlessly"], ["arrived", "left", "stopped", "stayed"], ["news", "smile", "act", "deed"], ["so", "but", "and", "or"], ["give", "receive", "produce", "have"], ["words", "behavior", "attitude", "action"], ["warning", "reminding", "accusing", "informing"], ["adapts", "adjusts", "adopts", "adores"], ["clear", "reliable", "aware", "certain"], ["of", "from", "as", "out"], ["sadly", "fortunately", "angrily", "cheerfully"], ["travelers", "buyers", "bosses", "diners"], ["rainstorm", "snow", "cold", "heat"]], "answers": ["A", "A", "B", "C", "B", "D", "A", "B", "B", "A", "B", "A", "C", "D", "C", "C", "B", "D", "A", "A"]}
