{"article": "Culture can affect not just language and customs, but also how people experience the world on surprisingly basic levels. Researchers, with the help of brain scans, have _ shocking differences in perception between Westerners and Asians, what they see when they look at a city street, for example, or even how they are _ of a simple line in a square, according to findings published in a(n) _ science journal. In Western countries, culture makes people think of themselves as highly _ entities. When looking at scenes, Westerners tend to focus more on central objects than on their surroundings. East Asian cultures, however, _ inter-dependence, When Easterners look at a scene, they tend to focus on the surroundings as well as the object. Using an experiment _ two tasks, Dr. Hedden asked subjects to look at a line simply to estimate its length, a task that played to American's _ . In another, they estimated the line's length relative to the size of a square, an easier task for the Asian. The level of brain activity, by _ blood flow, was then measured by Brain Scanners. The experiment found that although there was no difference in performance, and the tasks were very easy, the levels of activity in the subjects' brain were different . For the Americans, areas _ to attention were more favorable to them, when they worked on the task they tended to find more difficult --- estimating the line's size relative to the square. The findings are a _ of more than ten years of previous experimental research into East-West differences. In one study, for instance researchers _ people a choice among five pens; four red and one green. Easterners were more likely to choose a red pen, and Westerners were more likely to choose the green one. Culture does not only make a(n) _ on how you see the world, but how you choose to understand and internalize it. But such habits can be changed. Some psychological studies suggest that when an Easterner goes to the West or vice versa, habits of thought and perception also begin to change. Such research gives us _ to how our brain works and holds new promises for us to develop programs to improve our memory techniques and _ our learning skills.", "options": [["recovered", "revealed", "rejected", "replaced"], ["aware", "sensitive", "capable", "ignorant"], ["essential", "complex", "leading", "inviting"], ["independent", "creative", "cooperative", "responsible"], ["neglect", "rely", "compliment", "emphasize"], ["involving", "referring", "joining", "participating"], ["respect", "favor", "surprise", "resistance"], ["reducing", "adding", "tracking", "speeding"], ["objective", "associated", "opposite", "linked"], ["comment", "reflection", "reaction", "respond"], ["provided", "offered", "supplied", "handed"], ["agreement", "effort", "impact", "affect"], ["clues", "ideas", "concepts", "suggestions"], ["rise", "enable", "decrease", "enhance"]], "answers": ["B", "A", "C", "A", "D", "A", "B", "C", "D", "B", "B", "C", "A", "D"]}
