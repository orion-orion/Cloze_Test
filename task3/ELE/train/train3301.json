{"article": "Ten, nine, eight, seven...zero--lift off. These words _ like music to an astronomer's ears. As the countdown progresses, the rocket's engines _ and give it the required push to tear through the atmosphere and _ the earth's gravitation. These rockets take astronauts and manmade satellites into _ . The satellites are used for communication, weather monitoring and research. But how do satellites _ up without falling down, you _ ask? Take a strong rope. Tie a small stone to one _ to make a sling. Rotate the sling using one hand, you will _ that the rope straightens out and becomes _ as the sling rotates. As soon as you stop rotating, the rope slackens again. _ does the rope tighten on being rotated? The answer to this question will _ the answer to our query how satellites remain in space without _ down. When the sling is rotated, there are two _ acting on the stone. The force of rotation, which tries to take the stone away from you and the force applied by your hand, which tries to _ the stone towards you.  _ you are rotating the sling, the two forces balance each other out and _ the stone keeps going round and round. If you _ the sling midway, the sling will fly off. A satellite works in the same way. One of the two _ forces acting on the satellite is the force of gravitation. The other force is that which is created by the rotation of the satellite _ the earth. An orbiting satellite has these two forces balanced out so the satellite doesn't fall down to the earth.", "options": [["look", "seen", "feel", "sound"], ["hire", "fire", "break", "rush"], ["escape", "reach", "increase", "decrease"], ["universe", "world", "space", "stars"], ["stay", "put", "keep", "take"], ["should", "might", "dare", "ought"], ["side", "top", "middle", "end"], ["watch", "notice", "examine", "observe"], ["loose", "strong", "tight", "short"], ["What", "How", "Which", "Why"], ["provide", "make", "receive", "accept"], ["lying", "falling", "breaking", "turning"], ["forces", "powers", "strengths", "energy"], ["push", "drag", "throw", "pull"], ["Though", "While", "Unless", "Until"], ["however", "otherwise", "therefore", "instead"], ["release", "tie", "fasten", "interrupt"], ["familiar", "important", "opposite", "possible"], ["through", "into", "above", "around"]], "answers": ["D", "B", "A", "C", "A", "B", "D", "B", "C", "D", "A", "B", "A", "D", "B", "C", "A", "C", "D"]}
