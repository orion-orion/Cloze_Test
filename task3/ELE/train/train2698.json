{"article": "When Dave was eighteen, he bought a secondhand car for 200 so that he could travel to and from work more _ than by bus. It worked quite well for a few years, but then it got so old, and it was costing him _ much in repairs that he decided that he had better _ it. He asked among his friends to see if anyone was particularly _ to buy a cheap car, but they all knew that it was falling to pieces, so _ of them had any desire to buy it. Dave's friend Sam saw that he was _ when they met one evening, and said, \"What's _ , Dave?\" Dave told him, and Sam answered, \"Well, what about advertising it in the paper? You may _ more for it that way than the cost of the advertisement!\" Thinking that Sam's _ was sensible ,he put an advertisement in an evening paper, which read \"For sale: small car, _ very little petrol, only two owners. Bargain at 50.\" For two days after the advertisement first appeared, there was no _ .But then on Saturday evening he had an enquiry .A man rang up and said he would like to _ him about the car. \"All right,\" Dave said, feeling happy. He asked the man whether ten o'clock the next morning would be _ or not. \"Fine,\" the man said, \"and I'll _ my wife. We intend to go for a ride in it to _ it.\" The next morning, at a quarter to ten, Dave parked the car in the square outside his front door, _ to wait there for the people who had _ his advertisement. Even Dave had to _ that the car really looked like a wreck .Then, soon after he had got the car as clean _ it could be, a police car stopped just behind him and a policeman got out. He looked at Dave's car and then said, \"Have you reported this _ to us yet, sir?\"?", "options": [["directly", "safely", "easily?", "properly"], ["such", "so", "very", "too?"], ["keep", "repair", "sell", "throw?"], ["lucky", "anxious", "ashamed", "generous?"], ["some", "neither", "most", "none"], ["delighted", "upset", "calm", "astonished?"], ["on", "it", "that?", "up"], ["learn", "miss", "find", "get"], ["message", "advice", "request", "description?"], ["loses", "uses", "has", "spends"], ["doubt", "help", "answer", "trouble"], ["see", "tell", "agree", "call"], ["exact", "early", "suitable", "late"], ["follow", "meet", "introduce", "bring"], ["recognize", "gain", "admire", "test"], ["happening", "turning", "meaning", "failing"], ["read", "inserted", "answered", "placed"], ["forget", "admit", "disagree", "show"], ["that", "as", "so", "such"], ["bargain", "sale", "result", "accident"]], "answers": ["C", "B", "C", "B", "D", "B", "D", "D", "B", "B", "C", "A", "C", "D", "D", "C", "C", "B", "B", "D"]}
