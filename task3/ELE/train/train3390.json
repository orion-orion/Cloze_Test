{"article": "Nine years ago around Christmas, I was on a Captiva Island beach at sunrise. I crouched low there and was lost in the false hope of finding a treasure larger than the small _ on the shore. A man ran slowly along the waves _ my direction. When he came near me, he slowed to a walk. I didn't _ him until he was almost standing over me. Too young to be _ of strangers, I got on my feet and looked at him. It was then that I saw what was in his _ , a beautiful bright cream-colored shell, the kind of thing that I was looking for. He smiled as I stared in _ , and then, to my shock, he handed it to me. I held it _ before me like a diamond, not _ my eyes. \"I think you will like it,\" he said, and then continued his _ down the beach.I do not _ his voice, his clothes or even his face, _ I do still have the shell, and the greatest lesson I've ever _ . Now the shell sits on my bedside table, not as _ as it was, but it is still there, a _ reminder that there is _ in the world. That man saved my belief in the kindness of people, and he saved my belief that one can find what means something in life. I see my shell every day, and I know that I can get through bad days because there are good things in my life. In the end, all that we have is _ we have done for others. The shell is _ to me, as important as another man who returned to the plane to _ me my lost jacket. I know that _ a difference in someone's life, no matter how big or small, is what truly matters, and that it is worth all the treasure in the world.", "options": [["shell", "frog", "fish", "diamond"], ["to", "in", "through", "for"], ["recognize", "know", "follow", "notice"], ["tired", "fond", "shy", "proud"], ["clothes", "coat", "hand", "bag"], ["despair", "fear", "disappointment", "amazement"], ["formally", "calmly", "hopefully", "carefully"], ["imagining", "believing", "thinking", "presenting"], ["run", "walk", "ride", "drive"], ["respect", "realize", "remember", "remind"], ["but", "or", "unless", "so"], ["accepted", "taken", "learned", "received"], ["dirty", "hard", "bright", "soft"], ["noisy", "wise", "quiet", "stupid"], ["equality", "kindness", "bravery", "honesty"], ["what", "how", "where", "why"], ["necessary", "important", "valuable", "essential"], ["sell", "give", "remove", "buy"], ["telling", "getting", "doing", "making"]], "answers": ["A", "B", "D", "C", "C", "D", "D", "B", "A", "C", "A", "C", "C", "C", "B", "A", "B", "B", "D"]}
