{"article": "Appeal to Emotion  My childhood left three months ago on a plane to Austria. It was a _ day when my baby cousins moved away. My cousins were a fundamental part of my life; _ they were not with me, they were on my mind. They brought back the untroubled days of my childhood, _ games, adventures and silliness, but they also helped _ me from an at-times selfish teenager into a responsible adult. My aunt and uncle moved here from Boston with their 1-year-old daughter Yasmeen. They lived in an apartment on the side of our house and I was _ to have our family, especially a baby girl, so close to us Yasmen had close friendship with each of my sisters, but I knew the one that _ between us was the strongest. As she began to walk on her own and talk in full sentences, I realized my great _ upon her. I noticed that she'd _ some of my unpleasant actions, _ with her mother after I had done the same. Yasmeen made me realize what being a good _ really was. When Maya was born, Yasmeen had a hard time _ . She was jealous of the attention we all paid to her new younger sister, so I did my best to keep her company when she might have not been _ . Once Yasmeen overcame her jealousy, she was able to _ Maya's presence, like we all did. I tried to take advantage of our times together, doing my best to _ my schedule for my two favorite people. My _ with Yasmeen and Maya has taught me the importance of influential people. I know that I have helped Yasmeen and Maya _ , but \"the babies\" have had an even greater influence on my own life. They have shown me how to be a parent, a sister, a child and most importantly, a friend. Our _ has made me a better person----more patient person, with the ability to _ endless questions and spilled juice; an _ person, able to have fun and be happy with other; a role model, _ the babies idea about right and wrong, and a compassion person,able to forgive and love.", "options": [["sad", "busy", "fine", "relaxing"], ["until", "before", "when", "unless"], ["against", "through", "besides", "for"], ["lead", "challenge", "mature", "encourage"], ["overjoyed", "embarrassed", "surprised", "afraid"], ["ended", "started", "survived", "developed"], ["pressure", "dependence", "mercy", "influence"], ["doubt", "regret", "copy", "guide"], ["debating", "arguing", "negotiating", "checking"], ["leader", "partner", "friend", "example"], ["sharing", "adjusting", "recognizing", "struggling"], ["noticed", "admired", "comforted", "protected"], ["ignore", "mind", "sense", "enjoy"], ["affect", "accept", "free", "ruin"], ["instruction", "experiment", "experience", "interview"], ["grow", "succeed", "think", "behave"], ["meeting", "relationship", "responsibility", "respect"], ["interview", "tolerate", "repeat", "avoid"], ["honest", "independent", "aggressive", "enthusiastic"], ["showing", "writing", "awarding", "permitting"]], "answers": ["A", "C", "B", "C", "A", "D", "D", "C", "B", "D", "B", "A", "D", "C", "C", "A", "B", "B", "D", "A"]}
