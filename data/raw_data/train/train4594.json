He was obsessed with this desire --- he ate, slept, and walked with one and only dream: to die, having accomplished every single thing he was able to accomplish. There were so many things he could do. He felt like the whole world could be his, _ he set his mind to it. He knew that his _ had no limits. He knew that he could accumulate _ that would dwarf that of ancient kings; he knew that he could _ books that would shake the minds of generations; he knew that he could _ things that would forever change the lives of millions of people. He lived, constantly feeling the power within --- and that power knew no bounds. There was only one problem: having such a potential, but only one _ , he had to make a choice. He had to decide where to _ all of his ability. Making that decision was extremely hard, for any _ meant cutting off some future achievements. In the meantime, he went to school, graduated, found a job, married, and _ children. And he spent every minute of his spare time trying to decide _ he should bring his potential into full play. Time went by, and he grew _ . Some roads he used to dream about became closed to him. But there was still so much he could accomplish. One day, a sudden chest pain made him come home early. He dragged his feet to the bathroom. There, feeling _ , he looked in the mirror. A worn-out, gray-haired man stared back at him. He looked _ into these eyes and, all of a sudden, _ one simple truth. The next moment, the pain came again, and his heart stopped _ forever. The truth that came upon him was rather simple: People only flatter themselves (,) by thinking that they could have _ this or that if not for such-and-such circumstances. Yet this is nothing but _ .

In fact, _ you don't achieve is something you're not capable of achieving.", "options": [["before", "since", "if", "though"], ["wisdom", "potential", "world", "freedom"], ["courage", "interest", "knowledge", "power"], ["write", "read", "buy", "edit"], ["invent", "acquire", "adopt", "destroy"], ["step", "life", "chance", "condition"], ["promote", "accumulate", "increase", "apply"], ["choice", "mistake", "failure", "effort"], ["assisted", "loved", "raised", "punished"], ["why", "where", "when", "whether"], ["greedier", "wiser", "older", "cruder"], ["sleepy", "weak", "satisfied", "comfortable"], ["carelessly", "secretly", "angrily", "closely"], ["realized", "remembered", "reminded", "created"], ["fueling", "starting", "beating", "moving"], ["learned", "achieved", "undertaken", "doubted"], ["reality", "history", "imagination", "record"], ["unimportant", "necessary", "unbelievable", "ordinary"], ["and", "even", "or", "as"], ["what", "which", "that", "how"]], "answers": ["C", "B", "D", "A", "A", "B", "D", "A", "C", "B", "C", "B", "D", "A", "C", "B", "C", "B", "C", "A"]}
