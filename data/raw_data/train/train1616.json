{"article": "The inhalation of asbestos particles is associated with a number of lung diseases, such as asbestosis and _ cancer. Asbestosis is caused by the entry of asbestos particles into the wall of the alveoli, causing scarring which limits the functioning of the lungs. The lung _ its elasticity and may change shape. The initial symptoms of asbestosis are a tightness in the chest and breathlessness. In its _ stages, sufferers develop the barrel-shaped chests associated with emphysema, cyanosis, (where the skin takes a bluish _ ) and club fingers. Lung cancer, the generic _ for malignant tumors of the alveoli and bronchial tubes, has been shown to be directly _ to the inhalation of asbestos particles. As in the case of asbestosis, there is generally a period of inactiveness which may _ from 25 to 30 years after initial exposure, despite the _ of further exposure. Research suggests that there is a direct correlation between the degree of exposure to asbestos and the incidence of lung cancer. Where exposure occurs, the level of risk is further _ by cigarette smoking. Asbestos workers who smoke cigarettes have a 90% greater risk of catching lung cancer than workers who do not _ . Exposure to blue asbestos has been shown to producemesothelioma, a rare cancer of the outer lining of the lung or pleura. In a normal population the incidence of mesothelioma is extremely _ . Where epidemiological surveys have revealed a higher incidence of the disease, it is almost always related to _ exposure. _ changes in lung tissue caused by exposure to asbestos are pleural plaques and effusions. The former refer to a thickening of the lining of the chest wall, whereas the latter consists of a collection of fluid in the chest region outside the lungs. Pleural plaques commonly remain undiagnosed and generally have no detrimental effect on health.", "options": [["skin", "blood", "liver", "lung"], ["loses", "gains", "improves", "tightens"], ["early", "formal", "later", "final"], ["size", "color", "sound", "smell"], ["noun", "term", "way", "approach"], ["related", "revealed", "compared", "exposed"], ["disappear", "spread", "live", "extend"], ["presence", "activeness", "absence", "intensity"], ["decreased", "lost", "doubled", "increased"], ["diet", "drink", "smoke", "fare"], ["high", "low", "common", "frequent"], ["lead", "asbestos", "carbon", "hydrogen"], ["Three", "Some", "No", "Other"]], "answers": ["D", "A", "C", "B", "B", "A", "D", "C", "D", "C", "B", "B", "D"]}
