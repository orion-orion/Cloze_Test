{"article": "Hot lava flows down a Hawaiian mountainside. Farther up the slope, volcanologist Ken Hon picks his way slowly across the _ surface. The hot lava is slippery to walk on. \"It's like walking on ice,\" Hon says. \"But the bottom part of your boots starts to _ a little. You'll get burned _ you fall.\" Hon plants his feet carefully and slowly. He's _ data on the lava flowing out of Kilauea, a volcano that has been erupting since 1983. _ the lava's movements can save lives on the slopes below. But Hon must be _ . New waves of lava are flowing down toward him. Every few minutes he looks up to see _ the streams are and makes sure the _ lava hasn't cut off his escape route. \"It's _ out there, like the heat from an oven,\" Hon says. \"Up close, you have to wear firefighters' clothes _ the clothes you're wearing don't catch fire or melt.\" \"Back in 1990, lava entered the town of Kalapana. The lava moved slowly but steadily,\" Hon says. \"We had to evacuate people from about 150 homes. The lava _ forward and consumed all of the houses.\" _ , everyone escaped. But today Kalapana is buried under 30 feet of lava. Volcanoes aren't _ to Hon. They're fascinating and exciting. \"My _ thing is to come out at the edge of a lava lake. Sometimes I've had to sleep with a gas mask on.\" Still, Hon knows how to keep _ and knows when the lava is _ . \"All of a sudden, it gets really bright inside your _ !\" he says, laughing. But the _ is worth it, because the more Hon and other scientists can learn about volcanoes, the safer they can keep the people who live around these powerful forces of nature.", "options": [["calm", "frozen", "flat", "rough"], ["bend", "sink", "melt", "fly"], ["though", "because", "if", "unless"], ["collecting", "providing", "exchanging", "sharing"], ["Knowing", "Stopping", "Filming", "Remembering"], ["smart", "careful", "silent", "creative"], ["where", "how", "which", "what"], ["hardening", "moving", "cooling", "amazing"], ["powerful", "crowded", "empty", "hot"], ["or", "while", "but", "so"], ["leaned", "inched", "put", "looked"], ["Strangely", "Fortunately", "Hopefully", "Gradually"], ["similar", "interesting", "scary", "important"], ["lucky", "main", "worrying", "favorite"], ["safe", "busy", "comfortable", "quiet"], ["different", "distant", "close", "slow"], ["bag", "tent", "car", "house"], ["change", "view", "result", "danger"]], "answers": ["D", "C", "C", "A", "A", "B", "A", "C", "D", "D", "B", "B", "C", "D", "A", "C", "B", "D"]}
