{"article": "My nephew's 10!-year-!old son came for a visit one hot, July weekend. I persuaded him to _ inside and joined him in a game. After _ for an hour, I suggested that we relax for a while. I fell into my favourite recliner to let my neck muscles relax. He had slipped out of the room and I was catching a few enjoyable _ of peace and quiet. \"Look, Alice,\" he said enthusiastically as he _ over to the chair where I was sitting. \"I found a kite. Could we go outside and _ it?\" Glancing out of a nearby window, I noticed it was _ outside. \"I'm sorry. Tripper,\" I said, sad to see his _ eyes. \"The wind is not _ today.
