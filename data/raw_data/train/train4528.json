Bruce ,the interviewer ,was politely sympathetic, and didn't probe any _ .He acknowledged my loss and ,with great respect ,moved on to another _ . After the next _ of interview , Bruce took me to lunch with another manager .Then he asked me to take a _ with him. He told me that he , _ , had lost his wife .And he had also been married 20 years and had three children. In his sharing, I realized that he had _ the same pain _ I had , a pain that was almost _ to explain to someone who had not _ a loved _ . He offered his business card and home phone number and _ that, if I needed help or just wanted someone to talk to , I should feel _ to give him a call. No matter whether I got the job or not, he wanted me to know that he was there if I _ needed any help.
