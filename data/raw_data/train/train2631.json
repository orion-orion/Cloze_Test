I can still remember the very important day that has _ my whole life. I did so _ Then the _ day came. My father was asked to come to school to _ with my teacher, Ms King. You can t imagine how angry and _ my father was when he heard about my \"excellent achievement\". He _ at me:\"since you can t even count from 'ONE 'to 'TEN', what are you able to be when you _ up? Now, tell me!\"I was scared and _ and didn t know what to say and tears came immediately into my eyes. Then the most unforgettable time in my life came. \"Maybe he can be a boxing refereeone day. That _ only needs him to count from 'ONE' to 'NINE', which may _ him well.\" Ms King looked into my eyes and firmly said.
