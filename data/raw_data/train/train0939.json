{"article": "You have waited 45 minutes for the valuable 10 minutes' break between classes. But when the bell for the next class rings, you can't _ how quickly time has passed. If you are familiar with this _ , you'll know how time flies when you are having fun and _ when you are bored. Now scientists have come up with a reason why this is the case. Scans have shown that patterns of activity in the brain _ according to how we focus on a task. When we are _ , we concentrate more on how time is passing. And this makes our brains _ the clock is ticking more slowly. In an experiment _ by a French laboratory, 12 volunteers watched an image _ researchers monitored their brain activity. The volunteers were told to _ concentrate on how long an image appeared for, then focus on the color of the image, and thirdly, study both duration and color. The results showed that the brain was more active when the volunteers paid attention to more subjects. It is thought that if the brain is _ focusing on many aspects of a task, it has to _ its resources, and pays less attention to the clock. _ , time passes without us really _ it, and seems to go quickly. If the brain is not so active, it concentrates its _ energies on monitoring the passing of time. As a result , time seems to drag. Next time you feel bored in class , perhaps you should pay more attention to what the teacher is saying!", "options": [["guess", "learn", "believe", "doubt"], ["view", "point", "scene", "experience"], ["drags", "stops", "backs", "gains"], ["change", "develop", "grow", "slow"], ["sleepy", "bored", "excited", "active"], ["report", "think", "decide", "see"], ["produced", "carried", "tried", "performed"], ["so", "when", "while", "but"], ["partly", "quickly", "how", "first"], ["busy", "likely", "ready", "sure"], ["focus", "gather", "reach", "spread"], ["However", "Furthermore", "Therefore", "Finally"], ["recognizing", "watching", "noticing", "counting"], ["enough", "full", "right", "proper"]], "answers": ["C", "C", "A", "A", "B", "B", "D", "C", "D", "A", "D", "C", "C", "B"]}
