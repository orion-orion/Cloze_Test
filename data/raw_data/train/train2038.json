{"article": "My daughter and I finally got around to changing all the electronic pictures stored on our computers and cellphones into _ ones that we could actually hold in our hands and put into photo albums. It was amazing looking through decades of our lives. There I was not even 5 years old. I looked at that boy and all those _ versions of myself for a long time. I wondered what I would say to them _ I had a chance. I knew that I would tell them to relax and not worry about life's _ so much. I would tell them that they would solve all the problems they could and get through the ones they couldn't. I would tell them to enjoy and _ each day as it comes. I would tell them that every day has its own _ and simple pleasures and they should _ them all. I would tell them to hug more, laugh more, and say \"I love you\" more. I would _ them to take in more sunsets and to turn off the television every so often and go watch the stars. I would tell them to sing along with the radio and read a good book every _ they get. I would tell them to _ pass up the opportunity to pet a dog or _ another human being. Most of all, _ ,I would tell them to just love, because that's what we are here to do.  Of course , I know that none of us can go backward in this life. Life can only go _ . As you go forward in your own life, always take with you the wisdom you have _ , the kindness you have shared, and the _ you have received. As you go forward, always try to be the best person you can be and always remember to just love and be loved in return.", "options": [["colored", "expected", "printed", "idealized"], ["younger", "weaker", "happier", "newer"], ["since", "unless", "as", "if"], ["influences", "troubles", "changes", "failures"], ["waste", "call", "win", "value"], ["expectations", "ways", "delights", "plans"], ["receive", "appreciate", "find", "provide"], ["warn", "allow", "advise", "promise"], ["chance", "reason", "success", "moment"], ["always", "Sometimes", "never", "ever"], ["welcome", "ask", "believe", "help"], ["therefore", "though", "otherwise", "instead"], ["well", "forward", "quickly", "smoothly"], ["gained", "proved", "accepted", "doubted"], ["attention", "prizes", "honors", "love"]], "answers": ["C", "A", "D", "B", "D", "C", "B", "C", "A", "C", "D", "B", "B", "A", "D"]}
