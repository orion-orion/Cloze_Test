{"article": "About a month ago, while in the drive through at Starbucks, I noticed a woman in a car behind me who appeared to be having a bad day. There were two kids in the back who seemed to have too much _ at 8 am on a Sunday morning, because they were shouting loudly. The _ moved slowly and at one point while I was pulling the car forward, the sad woman behind me _ my car. I could tell this _ her. The entire time that I waited in line for my coffee this woman didn't _ . Looking back at her I could tell she was wondering \"Why me? Why today?\" When I _ up and paid for my coffee I requested that the barista of Starbucks give the woman behind me a smile card and paid for her coffee. Just 30 minutes later I was again _ in line at Starbucks. I heard a slam of a car door but thought nothing of it. I was _ when the same woman came up to my driver's side window. She _ me a twenty-dollar bill and the same smile card I had given to her. She smiled and said, \"These are for you. You are the _ one who gave these to me _ , right? All I need you to do is ask the barista to give the _ back to me.\" It was amazing! It was as if this woman had been waiting to show her _ for what I had done! When she got back into her _ today she was all smiles. I could tell she had the same feeling as I had on that early Sunday morning. It was nice to have my coffee paid for, but what made me feel even better was seeing the happiness and smile on her face. As I pulled out of the drive-thru, she waved and yelled out, \"Have a _ day!\" I yelled back \"You too!\" and waved her goodbye.", "options": [["force", "strength", "power", "energy"], ["line", "time", "sun", "bus"], ["knocked", "touched", "kicked", "watched"], ["excited", "calmed", "worried", "entertained"], ["apologize", "smile", "complain", "bother"], ["pulled", "looked", "turned", "walked"], ["standing", "waiting", "parking", "pacing"], ["amused", "confused", "disappointed", "shocked"], ["handed", "owed", "presented", "asked"], ["clever", "kind", "honest", "modest"], ["privately", "secretly", "originally", "totally"], ["card", "change", "bill", "coffee"], ["consideration", "respect", "desire", "appreciation"], ["office", "home", "car", "room"], ["free", "quiet", "regular", "good"]], "answers": ["D", "A", "A", "C", "B", "A", "B", "D", "A", "B", "C", "B", "D", "C", "D"]}
