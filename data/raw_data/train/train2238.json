{"article": "I have two friends who love backpacking. They spent a lot of time in a part of New York State's Adirondack Mountains. It consists of 46 mountains with a height of over 4,000 feet. The Adirondack Mountain Club gives _ recognition, and an award, to anyone who _ all 46 mountains. My two friends decided to go for this award. Now what you have to understand is that _ many of the 46 mountains have well-marked _ to their summits , others are not marked at all. You have to \"bushwhack \" using a compass and a map. My friends had climbed 45 of the mountains. They had just one _ -- it was the most _ requiring bushwhacking. A hiking path led past the base of the mountain, but from that point they were on their own. Early one morning they left their _ and walked five miles on the hiking path to the base of a chain of mountains. When they arrived, they _ that they had left their compass and map back in camp. Rather than returning to the camp, they decided to bushwhack without the compass and map. For hours they _ uphill enduring heat, thick bush, and black flies. _ , late in the afternoon they found themselves at the _ of a mountain successfully. They were exhausted but _ . The feeling was short-lived, however. When they looked across the valley, they _ another higher mountain. They had climbed the _ one! It was too _ that weekend to put their error right. They had to _ another four months to climb the right mountain. This story _ us a good lesson. Often in life we put in a great effort to reach a goal. But without the right \"map\" and \"compass\", it is _ to get \"lost\".", "options": [["special", "similar", "normal", "general"], ["describes", "draws", "observes", "climbs"], ["while", "since", "because", "unless"], ["paths", "rivers", "views", "avenues"], ["occupied", "left", "deserted", "missed"], ["interesting", "changeable", "reachable", "remote"], ["house", "room", "camp", "yard"], ["ignored", "discovered", "sensed", "explained"], ["jumped", "wandered", "ran", "walked"], ["Immediately", "Surely", "Finally", "Hopefully"], ["bottom", "top", "slope", "base"], ["embarrassed", "moved", "disturbed", "excited"], ["admired", "checked", "saw", "appreciated"], ["strange", "wrong", "distant", "steep"], ["late", "dangerous", "puzzling", "helpless"], ["save", "wait", "gain", "put"], ["sends", "tells", "recommends", "teaches"], ["easy", "hard", "annoying", "discouraging"]], "answers": ["A", "D", "A", "A", "B", "D", "C", "B", "D", "C", "B", "D", "C", "B", "A", "B", "D", "A"]}
