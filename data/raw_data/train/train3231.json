{"article": "Do you remember the name of your kindergarten teacher? I do,mine. Her name was Mrs. White. And I _ thinking she must be some older relation of Walt Disney's Snow White, _ she had the same bright blue eyes,short dark hair,red lips and fair skin. I don't remember much about what we _ in her class,but my mother once told me that we used to _ a lot. And I would bring back what I wrote and she would look at it and see there were so many _ . But no red corrections. And always a star. Sometimes _ a Good! But it _ my mother, so one day when she met Mrs. White at a Parent-Teacher meeting,she asked her why she never _ my mistakes and why she never red-pencilled in the right _ of words or pointed out grammatical errors. And Mrs. White said \"The children are just beginning to get _ about using words,about forming sentences. I don't want to dampen that enthusiasm with _ ink. Spelling and grammar can wait but the wonder of words _ ...\" I grew up learning to use words with loving _ like that. I 1ook back now and think she must have been a rather _ teacher -- to exercise such red-pen restraint ,to _ the joy,wonder and excitement of expression to flower -- however faultily -- like that,because to bloom is better than not to bloom. I used to _ beautiful a lot. Never could I quite remember that the e went _ the a. Eventually the e and a settled into their right places. I am glad I didn't wait on them though. Pretty is easier to spell but it doesn't hold as much as you _ sometimes. And thanks to Mrs. White I felt no _ about writing what I meant even if I couldn't quite spell it out. Because Life isn't Pretty. It's Beautiful.", "options": [["regret", "remember", "consider", "suggest"], ["because", "unless", "whether", "until"], ["admired", "believed", "collected", "earned"], ["analyze", "count", "write", "eat"], ["delays", "escapes", "exercises", "mistakes"], ["even", "still", "ever", "never"], ["relieved", "worried", "imited", "mentioned"], ["measured", "minded", "corrected", "improved"], ["spellings", "positions", "replies", "reports"], ["examined", "disappointed", "excited", "punished"], ["red", "extra", "colour", "heavy"], ["should", "will", "mustn't", "won't"], ["independence", "calmness", "knowledge", "confidence"], ["calm", "careful", "thorough", "extraordinary"], ["allow", "arrange", "remind", "require"], ["mistake", "misunderstand", "misspell", "misuse"], ["before", "after", "for", "without"], ["deserve", "mean", "obtain", "plan"], ["wonder", "difficulty", "intention", "choice"]], "answers": ["B", "A", "D", "C", "D", "A", "B", "C", "A", "C", "A", "D", "D", "D", "A", "C", "A", "B", "B"]}
