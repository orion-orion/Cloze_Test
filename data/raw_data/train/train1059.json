{"article": "Yesterday, I met a delightful woman at a work event. As we talked, she told me about her _ in Manila, Philippines. She spoke about the _ her culture values their elders,and she explained that children are _ from the time of birth to respect and _ people older than themselves. It was _ to hear that,so I enjoyed listening and learning. Here is her memory _ I found so beautiful: When she was growing up, her father had three jobs to care for his family. She said her dad never _ , and though he worked very hard, he always had _ for them. One day, her father was _ at his full-time job. For several months, he was mailed temporary disability checks _ he was recovering. When her father was able to return to his full-time job, he took all those disability _ that were sent to him while he was recovering and handed them back to the _ . He told them that he had two good legs and arms, and did not need this money. He told them to give the money to people who could not work, to people who _ needed it. The woman telling the story was a little girl at that time. She had _ her father that very day when he went back to his company _ all those unopened checks. \"My father is my hero,\" she _ . Lowering her voice, she said she would never forget what he did, and what an _ and influential mentor he was on how to live a life. From my communication with her, it was _ that her father's same sweet spirit had been passed down to this woman, and to her family. Hearing this story was so refreshing to my soul. I hope it is for you too.", "options": [["study", "childhood", "friendship", "hobby"], ["way", "pattern", "memory", "skill"], ["adopted", "brought", "attended", "educated"], ["greet", "admire", "honor", "welcome"], ["surprising", "refreshing", "convincing", "puzzling"], ["that", "what", "it", "this"], ["explained", "apologized", "complained", "regretted"], ["food", "clothing", "space", "time"], ["defeated", "injured", "fired", "punished"], ["while", "though", "because", "since"], ["presents", "goods", "checks", "awards"], ["company", "committee", "community", "charity"], ["frequently", "regularly", "actually", "normally"], ["observed", "accompanied", "supported", "reminded"], ["on", "about", "for", "with"], ["remarked", "reported", "sighed", "announced"], ["advanced", "effective", "inspiring", "honest"], ["possible", "necessary", "strange", "obvious"]], "answers": ["B", "A", "D", "C", "B", "A", "C", "D", "B", "A", "C", "A", "C", "B", "D", "A", "C", "D"]}
