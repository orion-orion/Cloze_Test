If there is one _ that I could give to each of you at Christmas time and _ day of the year,it would be that knowledge that you are loved.You are loved and watched over by a greater love than you could ever imagine.You are loved by God who _ you.In all the difficulties,problems,and heartaches this world _ ,you are loved.In all the obstacles you must overcome,challenges you must _ ,and pains you must go through,you are loved.In all the mistakes you make,times you stumble ,and _ paths you take,you are loved.You are loved every second in your life with a glorious love that will _ end.
