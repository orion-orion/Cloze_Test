{"article": "My husband Jack hated Christmas. He didn't hate the true meaning of Christmas , but the commercial aspects of it. Knowing he felt this _ , I decided one year to _ the usual shirts, sweaters, ties and so on. I reached for something _ just for Jack. The idea came in an unusual way. Our son Kevin, who was 12 that year, was _ at the junior level at the school he attended and shortly before Christmas, there was a non-league match _ a team sponsored by a church. These youngsters from the church, dressed in shoes so _ that shoestrings seemed to be the only thing holding them together, _ our son's team were in their beautiful new wrestling shoes. As the match began, I was _ to see that the other team was wrestling without a helmet designed to _ a wrestler's head. They clearly could not _ them. Well, our son's team ended up defeating them and took every weight class. But as the other team _ up from the mat, they walked around with a sense of pride that couldn't admit _ . Jack, seated beside me, shook his head _ , \"I wish just one of them could have won,\" he said. \"They have a lot of potential, but _ like this could take the heart right out of them.\" Jack loved _ and he knew them, having coached little league football, baseball.

His smile was the _ thing about Christmas that year.", "options": [["way", "joy", "music", "fear"], ["buy", "wear", "avoid", "give"], ["beautiful", "expensive", "new", "special"], ["wrestling", "weightlifting", "shooting", "boxing"], ["at", "against", "for", "on"], ["big", "small", "worn", "cheap"], ["because", "if", "while", "so"], ["frightened", "disappointed", "pleased", "surprised"], ["cover", "surround", "hide", "protect"], ["carry", "afford", "design", "expect"], ["dressed", "got", "turned", "cheered"], ["defeat", "evidence", "charge", "mistake"], ["gently", "sadly", "nervously", "gladly"], ["running", "winning", "losing", "shaking"], ["workmates", "parents", "friends", "kids"], ["invitation", "care", "idea", "money"], ["return", "sold", "bought", "left"], ["gift", "warning", "praise", "love"], ["brightest", "funniest", "ugliest", "darkest"]], "answers": ["A", "C", "D", "A", "B", "C", "C", "D", "D", "B", "B", "A", "B", "C", "D", "C", "C", "A", "A"]}
