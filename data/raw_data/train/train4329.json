{"article": "My friend had mentioned that her father had a lot of children's toys that he was looking to give away. She knew I had a three-year-old daughter so she thought of me first. I told her I would _ it if I could get some nice things for my daughter, which I wouldn't otherwise have been able to _ . When I met her father, he began to explain that he was _ once too and that he would hate to throw away things that could be very _ . At first, he thought of taking everything to the Salvation Army but then he _ to see if anyone he knew could use them first. When he was _ me around, I saw a bed, a slide , a kitchen set and many other things that made me surprised. As my eyes were wide and beginning to tear up a bit, he told me not to feel guilty. He said I was _ him by getting rid of them. As I was looking around, I did feel guilty, but I tried to remain more grateful than guilty because he told me to. Every time I tried to _ him for giving my daughter all these _ things, he would thank me right back and was grateful that these toys would be put to good use. So, sometimes when we are helped by others, the others that helped us are helped as a side-effect. In the _ of charity, it makes sense to feel grateful, but guilt is just as normal, I know we could have lived without a slide, which is why I do feel guilty, but I am grateful all the same because my daughter _ enjoys all these nice things!", "options": [["wear", "repair", "appreciate", "check"], ["believe", "afford", "see", "spare"], ["handsome", "young", "poor", "healthy"], ["suitable", "expensive", "useful", "dangerous"], ["continued", "forgot", "had", "decided"], ["driving", "showing", "turning", "sending"], ["helping", "saving", "troubling", "guiding"], ["praise", "move", "call", "thank"], ["wonderful", "cheap", "strange", "foreign"], ["habit", "end", "eyes", "corners"], ["sadly", "hardly", "secretly", "really"]], "answers": ["C", "B", "C", "C", "D", "B", "A", "D", "A", "C", "D"]}
