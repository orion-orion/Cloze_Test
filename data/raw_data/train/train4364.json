{"article": "A certain good woman one day said something that hurt her best friend of many years. She regretted it immediately and would have done anything to have taken the words back. So she went to an older, wiser woman in the village and asked for advice. Listening to her, the older woman _ the younger woman's distress and knew she must help her. She also knew she could _ ease her pain, but she could teach. Then, she said. \"There are _ things you need to do. The first is extremely difficult. Tonight, take your best _ pillows and open a small hole in each one. Then, _ the sun rises, you must put a single feather on the doorstep of each house in town. When you are through, come back to me. If you've done the first thing _ , I'll tell you the second.\" The young woman hurried home to prepare for her chore, even though the pillows were very _ to her and very expensive. All night long, she went from doorstep to doorstep. Her fingers were _ . The wind was so sharp that it caused her eyes to water, but she ran on through the _ streets, _ there was something she could do to put things _ the way they once were. Finally she placed the last feather on the steps of the last house. Just as the sun rose, she returned to the older woman. She was exhausted but _ , thinking that her efforts would be rewarded. \"Now,\" said the wise woman, \"Go back and _ your pillows. Then everything will be as it was before.\" The young woman was stunned, \"You know that's impossible! The wind blew away each feather as fast as I placed them on the doorsteps! You didn't say I had to get them back! If this is the second _ , then things will never be the same.\" \"That's true,\" said the older woman. \"Never forget. Each of your words is like a feather in the wind. Once spoken , no amount of effort, _ how heartfelt or sincere, can ever return them to your mouth. Choose your words well and guard them most of all in the presence of those you love.\"", "options": [["witnessed", "touched", "guessed", "sensed"], ["ever", "almost", "never", "seldom"], ["one", "two", "three", "four"], ["feather", "leather", "woolen", "cotton"], ["when", "after", "as", "before"], ["promptly", "absolutely", "completely", "unfortunately"], ["hard", "rare", "nice", "dear"], ["freezing", "freezingly", "froze", "frozen"], ["brightened", "widened", "darkened", "broadened"], ["amazing", "lucky", "thankful", "surprising"], ["on", "up", "off", "back"], ["tired", "relieved", "grateful", "nervous"], ["refill", "get", "purchase", "seek"], ["requirement", "situation", "consequence", "circumstance"], ["however", "whatever", "although", "regardless"]], "answers": ["D", "C", "B", "A", "D", "C", "D", "D", "C", "C", "D", "B", "A", "A", "D"]}
