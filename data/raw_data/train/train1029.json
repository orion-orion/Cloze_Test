{"article": "I'm Glad I got Sick Twenty-seven years ago I got sick. The reason I can remember the date so well is that being sick is what _ me to choose my future wife. She was just a good friend, but because she came over to my apartment, brought me medicine, and made me breakfast, I thought for the first time \"what a super wife she will _ for someone.\" I took her out to eat for helping me get over the flu. After that we became even better friends, but still _ thought of marriage. A few months later I was going to _ a new job in the Atlanta area, so Cathy helped me pack up boxes to get ready to leave. We _ a great time that day and had lunch together. Near the end of that day I _ a few tears in Cathy's eyes, so I asked what was _ . She said, \"I don't know if I can live _ you, you are my best friend.\" I said, \"I know, I've been thinking the _ thing.\" That day we decided to get married and we have been married ever since. We have had our _ times, as many others have had, but we are still best friends!  _ I get to the family unit in my Health class and we talk about _ ...I always tell this story. My students seem to love it because they learn that _ , sharing and caring about others is all that really _ in life, and that looks, money and other things are not important.  _ the way, my wife is 12 years younger than me, and she is beautiful. We have 2 beautiful children, but we still have dates on _ weekend. Cathy is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me! She is a fantastic mother, and the best wife a coach could ever have. Thank God I got sick 27 years ago!", "options": [["brought", "resulted", "followed", "caused"], ["develop", "get", "become", "prove"], ["much", "more", "less", "no"], ["take", "give", "hand", "continue"], ["spent", "had", "took", "cost"], ["noticed", "observed", "looked", "watched"], ["right", "terrible", "wrong", "awful"], ["with", "without", "by", "on"], ["different", "difficult", "similar", "same"], ["hard", "happy", "wonderful", "common"], ["Unless", "Until", "When", "Though"], ["health", "marriage", "exercise", "hobby"], ["taking", "supporting", "gaining", "giving"], ["matters", "works", "helps", "needs"], ["In", "By", "On", "Off"], ["any", "some", "all", "every"]], "answers": ["D", "C", "D", "B", "B", "A", "C", "B", "D", "A", "C", "B", "D", "A", "B", "D"]}
