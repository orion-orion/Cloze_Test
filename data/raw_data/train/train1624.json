{"article": "I remember my dad teaching me the power of language at a very young age. One fairly interesting event happened when I was eight. As a kid, I was always climbing trees, poles, and _ around upside down from the rafters of our house. So, it _ to no surprise for my dad to _ me at the top of a 30-foot tree swinging back and forth. Without realizing the tree could break or I could get _ , I just thought it was _ to be up so high. My cousin, Tammy, was in the same tree. She was hanging on the first big _ about ten feet below me. Tammy s mother also _ us at the exact time my dad did. About that time a huge gust of wind came over the tree and I could feel the tree begin to sway. I remembered my dad s _ over the wind yelling, Bart, _ on tightly. So I did. The next thing I know, I heard Tammy _ at the top of her lungs, _ flat on the ground. She had fallen out of the tree. I came down the tree to _ . My dad later told me why Tammy fell and I didn t. _ , when Tammy s mother felt the wind, she yelled out, Tammy, don t _ ! And Tammy did do that. My dad then _ to me that the mind has a very _ time dealing with a negative image. In order to deal with the _ of not falling, Tammy s brain had to first imagine falling, and then tell the brain not to do what it just imagined. However, my eight-year-old brain _ had an internal image of hanging on tightly. This Self-Talk is especially useful when you are _ to break a habit or set a goal. You can t imagine not doing something in your mind. The only way to accomplish it is to find a word for what you want to do. I m now a pretty good football player, because all my internal dialogue is _ and encourages me to win. All this I owe to my dad.", "options": [["walking", "hanging", "fooling", "playing"], ["got", "turned", "came", "led"], ["meet", "admire", "forbid", "find"], ["trapped", "hurt", "teased", "scolded"], ["fun", "tense", "scaring", "dizzy"], ["root", "trunk", "branch", "tree"], ["warned", "joined", "watched", "noticed"], ["sound", "voice", "wave", "laughter"], ["hold", "come", "go", "insist"], ["whispering", "laughing", "screaming", "singing"], ["lying", "sitting", "standing", "looking"], ["anxiety", "safety", "thrill", "sympathy"], ["Apparently", "Unbearably", "Vividly", "Unbelievably"], ["move", "jump", "fall", "sway"], ["apologized", "admitted", "referred", "explained"], ["difficult", "awesome", "precise", "special"], ["fear", "command", "reward", "possibility"], ["deliberately", "constantly", "gradually", "instantly"], ["failing", "attempting", "managing", "hoping"], ["negative", "subjective", "positive", "vague"]], "answers": ["B", "C", "D", "B", "A", "C", "D", "B", "A", "C", "A", "B", "A", "C", "D", "A", "B", "D", "B", "C"]}
