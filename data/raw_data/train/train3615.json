{"article": "Thanksgiving is one of the biggest American holidays. And at the center of Thanksgiving dinner is the turkey. You may wonder why the word \"turkey\" _ both a country and a bird that Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner. Many think the bird comes from the _ of Turkey. But turkey is not from Turkey. In fact, the fact that the turkey bird is called by that name is one big mistake. We could say it is a case of _ identity. First of all, \"Turkey\" has meant the \"land of the Turks\" since _ times.
