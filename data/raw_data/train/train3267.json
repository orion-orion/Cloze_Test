{"article": "Janelle used the phone of the helpful woman to call Cliff. Cliff played golf with a medical doctor almost every Saturday. Cliff, _ but glad his wife was alive, said he would be there _ . She told him to bring their son and her _ set of car keys, because her keys were in the _ purse. Cliff and Donovan arrived just before the police officer finished filling out his report. Cliff _ his wife gently. He told Donovan to drive home in Janelle's car. Cliff then asked the officer what the _ were of catching the attackers. The officer told Cliff that _ like this happened daily throughout southern California. Cliff _ the officer what could be done. \"I know this sounds ridiculous , but we police can no longer protect you law-abiding citizens. There are simply too many criminals. Tell all your _ relatives and friends one thing: Don't go anywhere alone, day or night. A woman by herself, even in public , might as well be carrying a bright neon sign that _ : 'Victim here-Come and get me!' I'm not _ to be telling you this, because _ the word gets out, tourism will suffer in southern California.\" The officer asked Janelle to _ the police report. He wished her a speedy _ , and promised to do his best to help put the attackers behind bars. He _ both of them that the two thugs now had their credit cards, address, car keys, and house keys. He suggested that they make the appropriate phone calls, _ the locks to their house, and get new keys for her car. Cliff told the officer that a couple of his friends were at his house, with guns, _ for intruders. Cliff and Janelle thanked the officer and the helpful woman. Cliff drove Janelle straight toward their family doctor.", "options": [["surprised", "angry", "unbelievable", "rough"], ["shortly", "gladly", "suddenly", "entirely"], ["own", "other", "rest", "spare"], ["missing", "broken", "stolen", "damaged"], ["shook", "hugged", "helped", "placed"], ["chances", "robbers", "police", "things"], ["criminals", "robberies", "situations", "scenes"], ["informed", "suggested", "asked", "argued"], ["male", "close", "familiar", "female"], ["writes", "tells", "says", "shows"], ["permitted", "adjusted", "advised", "supposed"], ["whether", "how", "if", "why"], ["sign", "carry", "make", "break"], ["move", "recovery", "sense", "travel"], ["told", "believed", "guessed", "reminded"], ["get", "keep", "change", "repair"], ["searching", "watching", "taking", "waiting"]], "answers": ["B", "A", "D", "C", "B", "A", "B", "C", "D", "C", "D", "C", "A", "B", "D", "C", "B"]}
