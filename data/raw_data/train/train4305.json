{"article": "In the 1960s, Douglas McGregor, one of the key thinkers in the art of management, developed the mow famous Theory X and Theory Y. Theory X is the idea that people instinctively _ work and will do anything to avoid it. Theory Y is the view that everyone has the potential to find satisfaction in work. In any case, despite so much evidence to the _ , many managers still agree to Theory X. They believe, for example , that their employees need constant supervision if they are to work effectively, or that decisions must be imposed from _ without consultation.

Another trend is off-site or _ management, where teams of people linked by e-mail and the Internet work on projects from their own houses. Project managers evaluate the _ of the team members in terms of what they produce for projects, rather than the amount of time they spend on them.", "options": [["desire", "seek", "lose", "dislike"], ["contrary", "expectation", "degree", "extreme"], ["outside", "inside", "below", "above"], ["replacing", "assessing", "managing", "encouraging"], ["refer", "contribute", "object", "apply"], ["agreement", "practice", "election", "impression"], ["bossy", "experienced", "western", "male"], ["asking", "training", "warning", "firing"], ["doubling", "maintaining", "reducing", "estimating"], ["honored", "left", "crowded", "compared"], ["economically", "traditionally", "inadequately", "occasionally"], ["deny", "admit", "assume", "ensure"], ["virtual", "ineffective", "day-to-day", "on-the-scene"], ["opinion", "risk", "performance", "attractiveness"]], "answers": ["D", "A", "D", "C", "B", "A", "D", "A", "C", "B", "B", "D", "A", "C"]}
