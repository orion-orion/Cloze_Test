{"article": "Many years ago,Mr. Smith asked me to be the referee on the grading of an examination question. He was about to give a student a _ for his answer to a physics question,while the student said he should receive a perfect _ ,I read the examination question:\"Show how it is possible to _ the height of a tall building with the _ of a barometer .\" The student had answered: \"Take the barometer to the top of the building, fasten a _ rope to it, _ the barometer to the street, and then bring it up, _ the length of the rope. That's the _ .\" I pointed out that the student really have a strong case for full credit ,since he had answered the question _ , but the answer did not prove competencein physics. I _ that the student have another try. I gave the student six minutes, with the _ that his answer should show some _ of physics. His answer reads:\"Take the barometer to the top of the building and lean _ the edge of the roof. Drop the barometer, _ its fall with a stop watch. Then using the formulas=1/2at2,calculate the height of the building.\" I gave the student _ full credit. Before I left, the student said he had _ answers. He said,\" The best way is _ to knock at the building manager's door. When he _ ,you say: \"Sir, I have a (n) _ barometer. If you will tell me the height of the building, I will _ you this barometer.\"", "options": [["tick", "zero", "mark", "comment"], ["score", "praise", "reward", "prize"], ["change", "raise", "determine", "find"], ["care", "aid", "effort", "improvement"], ["strong", "big", "beautiful", "long"], ["lower", "drop", "carry", "place"], ["covering", "folding", "measuring", "imagining"], ["height", "width", "size", "weight"], ["completely", "correctly", "seriously", "carefully"], ["demanded", "required", "insisted", "suggested"], ["warning", "advice", "order", "point"], ["wisdom", "technology", "knowledge", "gift"], ["on", "over", "against", "beyond"], ["stopping", "observing", "timing", "watching"], ["almost", "still", "simply", "briefly"], ["some", "other", "two", "no"], ["gradually", "surprisingly", "probably", "strangely"], ["asks", "shouts", "stares", "answers"], ["fine", "large", "dull", "deserted"], ["give", "lend", "sell", "show"]], "answers": ["B", "A", "C", "B", "D", "A", "C", "A", "B", "D", "A", "C", "A", "B", "D", "A", "C", "B", "C", "A"]}
