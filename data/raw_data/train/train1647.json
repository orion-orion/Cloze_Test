{"article": "Just as the stock market rises and falls in response to what people are willing to put their money behind, we have inside ourselves an inner economy that rises and falls in response to our beliefs about what is possible. Sometimes the degree to which we are willing to _ our belief systems determines the success of our inner economy. For example, imagine that your family of origin had a belief that musical talent was not something they _ . As a member of that group, you would likely _ that same belief about yourself. As a result, even if you had a great desire to create music, you might be _ to really get behind yourself. Because you might fear that your _ would not pay off.
