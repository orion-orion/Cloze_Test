{"article": "A man accused of failing to return more than 700 children's books to five different libraries was allowed to get out of prison yesterday after a book publisher agreed to pay his bail of $1,000. The publisher said, \" There's a story here. This is a man who _ books. He just can't let go of them. He hasn't stolen a(n) _ book. So what's the crime ? We think that Mr Barush has a story to tell. We plan to _ his story.\" When asked why he didn't return the books, Mr Barush said, \" Well, how could I? They became _ to me. I was afraid to return them because I knew that kids or dogs would get hold of these books and chew them up, _ them around, tear the _ , spill soda on them, and drown them in the toilet.\" He continued, \" Books are people, too! They talk to you, they take care of you, and they enrich you with _ and humor and love. A book is a member of my family. How could I kick it _ ? I repaired torn pages. I _ the dust on them with a _ cloth, I turned pages so they could _ and get some fresh air.\" \" Every week I _ them on their shelves so they could meet new friends. My books were HAPPY books. You could tell just by looking at them. Now they're all back in the library, on the floors, at the _ of all those runny-nosed kids. I can hear them calling me! I need to _ them. Excuse me. I have to go now.\"", "options": [["loves", "hates", "sells", "repairs"], ["interesting", "expensive", "single", "thick"], ["retell", "include", "discuss", "publish"], ["home", "teacher", "family", "enemy"], ["throw", "turn", "show", "invite"], ["words", "pages", "headlines", "shapes"], ["chance", "respect", "wisdom", "direction"], ["out", "up", "above", "below"], ["ignored", "covered", "replaced", "cleaned"], ["soft", "colorful", "dirty", "strong"], ["dance", "swim", "breathe", "sing"], ["discovered", "reorganized", "remembered", "introduced"], ["mercy", "charge", "center", "request"], ["borrow", "rescue", "answer", "recognize"]], "answers": ["A", "C", "D", "C", "A", "B", "C", "A", "D", "A", "C", "B", "A", "B"]}
