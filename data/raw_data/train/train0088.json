{"article": "After spending a weekend away with my adult son, I was so impressed by his generous heart that I sent him this letter. Dear son, I want to thank you for teaching me a very valuable lesson in life by the great example you _ . When we were eating at that cafe in Boston and a person who had _ his hamburger didn't have enough money to pay for it, without _ , you went over and _ the extra $2 into his hand. When we were leaving, you _ threw a five-cent coin onto the pavement and said something like, \"Some kid will really enjoy finding this.\" Last week, a young man ahead of me in the line at a petrol station didn't have _ money to pay for his petrol. I asked the money collector, \"How much _ is he?\" She told me he had meant to put $15 of petrol in his car _ he had been looking at the wrong gauge and had put in 15 _ , which came to a little over $20. That is an easy mistake as both gauges run fast. Something made me think of you and _ you did that night at the cafe in Boston. I handed the man $6. He was so _ and said, \"But why would you do this for me?\" I just smiled as I thought of you. Thank you, son, for teaching me that \"it's _ to give than to receive\". Now when I see a five-cent coin on the _ and want to pick it up, I think of you and leave it there, just in case some kid will get a kick out of finding it.
