Now scientists believe they have solved this _ . Researchers from Sheffield and Warwick Universities in England discovered the answer by chance . They used a super computer to observe the shell-making process while a new shell was _ . Then they found one protein called OC17 that is _ for forming eggshell. This is only found inside a chicken's body, which is proof that the _ came first. The team was _ looking at how animals and birds make eggshells but suddenly made their surprising _ . The big question now is where chickens came from. The _ is from dinosaurs. The research team said eggshells are one of nature's most _ creations. Professor John Harding from the team told reporters: \"Understanding how chickens make eggshells is fascinating in itself, but it can also be _ in designing new materials.\" Eggshells are very lightweight but incredibly strong. Even the most up-to-date materials _ by the world's top engineers can not produce anything as _ as an eggshell. Professor Harding added that _ eggshells could help to cure bone diseases and design materials for the construction industry.\"Nature has found wonderful ways that _ for all kinds of problems in materials science and technology -- we can learn a lot from them.\" he said.", "options": [["strangest", "best", "oldest", "longest"], ["puzzle", "story", "history", "idea"], ["breaking", "changing", "disappearing", "forming"], ["necessary", "easy", "kind", "impossible"], ["egg", "eggshell", "chicken", "dinosaur"], ["obviously", "originally", "thoughtfully", "surprisingly"], ["invention", "mistake", "statement", "discovery"], ["answer", "research", "key", "egg"], ["strange", "ridiculous", "funny", "amazing"], ["hopeful", "helpful", "respectful", "colorful"], ["bought", "cut", "designed", "carried"], ["brilliant", "ordinary", "ight", "strong"], ["finding", "watching", "studying", "making"], ["happen", "work", "wait", "look"]], "answers": ["C", "A", "D", "A", "C", "B", "D", "A", "D", "B", "C", "A", "C", "B"]}
