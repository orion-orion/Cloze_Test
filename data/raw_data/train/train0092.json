{"article": "Deo sat staring straight ahead, so as to think about this. Then they were _ a bridge so high he felt as if he were in the airplanes again, and Muhammad said, \"Manhattan,\" and _ at a horizon of buildings impossibly tall, _ giant trees, like a sky of pillared clouds at sunrise in the mountains. _ a time Deo began to notice vacant lots, and buildings with wood _ their windows. When Muhammad _ turned off a main avenue onto a side street, Deo wanted to ask, urgently, _ they were stopping here. A few yards away, a man stood urinating _ the wall of a building. The sidewalk was covered with empty cans and _ and all sorts of paper trash. Muhammad led the way _ a brick building with broken windows and letters scribbled here and there on the walls. High up on one wall there were three letters _ , as if each letter were swollen: P E N. He followed Muhammad _ , the air reeking of urine and excrement , up a staircase with a busted railing , _ finally into a room with a dirty wooden floor, a room with _ door and no furniture. At the end of a _ hallway, there was a toilet, completely stopped up. Muhammad said he stayed here to _ money. He didn't have to pay rent for this room. His whole reason for being in New York was to _ and save as much as he could. He would be _ for Senegal in a few weeks. Deo should do as he had--work here for a while and save, then start a new life. But he should do this _ back in Africa, not in New York. \"Because it's so hard here,\" Muhammad said.", "options": [["delivering", "travelling", "building", "crossing"], ["stared", "glared", "pointed", "shot"], ["like", "in", "as", "from"], ["Before", "When", "While", "After"], ["rushing", "passing", "covering", "flowing"], ["finally", "hopefully", "thankfully", "fortunately"], ["why", "what", "how", "where"], ["through", "against", "from", "off"], ["flowers", "bottles", "windows", "tables"], ["from", "on", "in", "toward"], ["heard", "read", "seen", "painted"], ["inside", "outside", "sideways", "upward"], ["but", "and", "or", "for"], ["all", "some", "any", "no"], ["sunny", "light", "dark", "bright"], ["keep", "save", "raise", "lose"], ["obtain", "achieve", "earn", "reach"], ["leaving", "arriving", "searching", "staying"], ["anywhere", "everywhere", "somewhere", "nowhere"]], "answers": ["D", "C", "A", "D", "C", "A", "A", "B", "B", "D", "D", "A", "B", "D", "C", "B", "C", "A", "C"]}
