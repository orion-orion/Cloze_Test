{"article": "Recently, we went on a vacation for a week that involved visiting four different ports in the sunny and warm climate of the Caribbean. There were _ of laughter, fun and great food. It's a _ thing when you go away that each day of the vacation also count down to the end and a return to work. It was twelve years since we went on a vacation, so this vacation was viewed with _ of a great break away from my daily routine. And we weren't _ . But there was something very different about this vacation compared to those when we worked in a corporative environment. The main _ was that when we returned, when the vacation was rapidly drawing to a close, we didn't have the same feeling of _ stress, anxiety and fear. In this recent vacation, it wasn't that we _ enjoyed the various fun and new activities, the break away from routine, the pleasure of touring different countries and cultures, the _ to do what we wanted when we wanted or the leisurely _ of each day that was significant. What was significant was that we didn't _ fear the last day of vacation. You see, we know that we were returning to what we love to do not what we had to do.
