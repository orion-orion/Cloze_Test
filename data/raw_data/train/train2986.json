{"article": "Fill Her Tank First The summer of 1975 I'd just graduated from college in Southern California and received a 1968 Ford Capri for a graduation present. I had my first job, in Los Angeles. One Sunday night, _ myself a very independent grown-up, I left my uncle's place in South Laguna after a visit, without _ to him that I had less than an _ of a tank of gas and no cash to buy _ on the way to L.A. I pulled onto the Pacific Coast Highway and watched the needle _ as I headed north. When I started running on fumes, I pulled into a gas station . There was no self-service at that time ; there were no credit cards, no ATMs. I begged the guy at the station. I _ write him a check for gas, I said, or I could sleep in my car and try to _ to a town with a bank the next morning. As he was informing me that I could sleep in my car but he'd have me _ , a station wagon pulled up to the next pump. The driver--- a thin, plain, middle-aged guy---overheard the tail end of my _ request. As the attendant went to serve him, he nodded at me. \" Fill her tank first,\" he said. \"Really?\" I said. Hope _ . \"Oh, thank you. Thank you. But please. I just need two dollars' _ . I just need to go home.\" \"Fill it,\" he _ to the attendant. Then to me, \"You will do the same one day, for someone else.\" I keep looking for that unlucky young person, _ to save her night on the road. Meanwhile, in case she never _ up, I try for other acts of random kindness. That _ driver is always at the pump a few feet away, _ the attendant to fill mine first.", "options": [["thinking", "hoping", "knowing", "showing"], ["confirming", "convincing", "admitting", "concerning"], ["eighty", "eight", "eighth", "eighths"], ["another", "more", "much", "some"], ["drop", "increase", "reduce", "decrease"], ["could", "might", "should", "must"], ["scramble", "drive", "climb", "walk"], ["ordered", "helped", "warned", "arrested"], ["tried", "succeeded", "reasoned", "failed"], ["increased", "raised", "accumulated", "fired"], ["value", "worthy", "worth", "money"], ["pardoned", "repeated", "said", "spoke"], ["ensuring", "supposing", "hoping", "considering"], ["shows", "goes", "grows", "comes"], ["easy-going", "polite", "powerful", "quiet"], ["introducing", "instructing", "interesting", "interacting"]], "answers": ["A", "C", "C", "B", "A", "A", "D", "D", "D", "A", "C", "B", "C", "A", "D", "B"]}
