{"article": "There was a time in my life when beauty meant something special to me. I lived in an orphanage and one Saturday morning after breakfast I returned to the dormitory and saw the house parent _ the beautiful monarch butterflies. I carefully watched as he caught these beautiful creatures, one after another, took them from the net and then _ straight pins through their head and wings, pinning them onto a heavy cardboard sheet.  How _ it was to kill something of such beauty. When he went inside to _ the phone, I walked up to the cardboard and looked at the butterfly who he had just pinned to the large paper. It was still moving about, so I reached down and touched it on the wing, _ one of the pins to fall out. It started flying around and around trying to get away, _ it was still pinned by one wing with the other straight pin. _ , its wing broke down and the butterfly fell to the _ and just quivered .  The next thing I remembered was that the house parent came back and started _ at me. I told him that I did not do anything but he did not _ me. He picked up the cardboard paper and started _ me on the top of the head. He threw the _ down on the ground and told me to pick it up and put it in the garbage can and then he left. I sat there in the dirt, trying to fit all the butterfly _ back together so I could _ them whole, but it was too _ to do so. So I _ for them and then I put them in a box and buried them in the bottom of the fort that I had _ in the ground near the blackberry bushes.  Every year when the butterflies would return to the orphanage and try to land on me I would _ them away because they did not know that the orphanage was a _ place to live and a very bad place to die.", "options": [["finding", "chasing", "playing", "driving"], ["put", "stuck", "cut", "fixed"], ["complicated", "excited", "cruel", "serious"], ["answer", "compose", "search", "confirm"], ["causing", "advising", "expecting", "wishing"], ["but", "and", "when", "if"], ["Obviously", "Finally", "Definitely", "Absolutely"], ["roof", "table", "bed", "ground"], ["smiling", "aiming", "yelling", "pointing"], ["believe", "recognize", "persuade", "overlook"], ["impressing", "touching", "hitting", "stressing"], ["pins", "clothes", "cardboard", "flowers"], ["leaves", "pieces", "fans", "characters"], ["obtain", "collect", "keep", "reserve"], ["moving", "hard", "pleasing", "convenient"], ["prayed", "wept", "bent", "applied"], ["attained", "betrayed", "bought", "built"], ["give", "throw", "drive", "put"], ["satisfying", "surprising", "wonderful", "terrible"]], "answers": ["B", "B", "C", "A", "A", "A", "B", "D", "C", "A", "C", "C", "B", "D", "B", "A", "D", "C", "D"]}
