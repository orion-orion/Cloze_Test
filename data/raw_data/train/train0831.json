{"article": "I believe listening is powerful medicine. Studies have shown it takes a _ about 18 seconds to interrupt a patient after he begins talking. It was a Sunday. I had one last patient to see. I _ her room in a hurry and stood at the doorway. She was an old woman, sitting at the edge of the bed, _ to put socks on her swollen feet. I crossed the threshold , spoke quickly to the nurse, and scanned her chart noting she was in stable condition. I was almost in the clear. I _ on the bedrail looking down at her. She asked if I could help put on her socks. Instead, I launched into a monologue that went _ like this, \"How are you feeling? Your sugars and blood pressure were high _ they're better today. The nurse mentioned you're _ to see your son who's visiting you today. It's nice to have family visit from far away. I bet you really look forward to seeing him.\" She _ me with a serious, authoritative voice. \"Sit down, doctor. This is my story, not your story.\" I was surprised and embarrassed. I sat down. I helped her with the socks. She began to tell me that her only son lived around the corner from her, but she had not seen him in five years. She believed that the stress of this _ greatly to her health problems. After hearing her story and putting on her socks, I asked if there was anything else I could do for her. She _ her head no and smiled. All she wanted me to do was to listen. Each story is different. Some are detailed; others are vague. Some have a beginning, middle and end; others wander _ a clear conclusion. Some are true; others not. Yet all those things do not really matter. What matters to the storyteller is that the story is heard without _ , assumption or judgment. Listening to someone's story costs less than expensive diagnostic testing but is key to healing and diagnosis. I often thought of _ that woman taught me, and I _ myself of the importance of stopping, sitting down and truly listening. And, not long after, in a(n) _ twist, I became the patient, with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis at age 31. Now, 20 years later, I sit all the time in a wheelchair. For as long as I could, I continued to see patients from my chair, but I had to resign when my hands were affected. I still teach medical students and other health care professionals, but now from the perspective of physician and patient. I tell them I believe in the power of listening. I tell them I know firsthand that immeasurable healing takes place within me when someone stops, sits down and listens to my story.", "options": [["professor", "teacher", "musician", "physician"], ["approached", "examined", "passed", "observed"], ["hoping", "expecting", "waiting", "struggling"], ["sat", "leaned", "lay", "stood"], ["nothing", "anything", "something", "everything"], ["so", "but", "though", "because"], ["anxious", "nervous", "worried", "upset"], ["urged", "begged", "stopped", "persuaded"], ["referred", "attached", "stuck", "contributed"], ["lowered", "hung", "shook", "waved"], ["with", "without", "by", "in"], ["distinction", "interruption", "Instruction", "attention"], ["that", "which", "what", "as"], ["reminded", "recalled", "required", "informed"], ["expected", "irregular", "regular", "unexpected"]], "answers": ["D", "A", "D", "B", "C", "B", "A", "C", "D", "C", "B", "B", "C", "A", "D"]}
