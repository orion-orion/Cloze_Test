{"article": "Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist. It's universally known that he was the _ of the Nobel Prize in Physics. He is best known for his _ 0f relativity, which holds that measurements of space and time _ according to conditions such as the state of motion of the observer. When he was a(n) _ , Einstein was fat and his head was so big that his mother _ it was damaged. And he was _ in learning how to speak. So his parents led him to _ a doctor. He had contempt toward authority, which led one _ to say that he would never amount to much. But when asked about this later, the headmaster denied that he had ever said so. But this qualities helped to make him a(n) _ . His contempt for authority led him to _ conventional wisdom. His slow _ development made him curious about ordinary things, such as _ and time which most adults took for granted. And he _ to think in pictures rather than words which gave him great help to his achievements. In 1905, Einstein _ and got his college certificate, but didn't get an academic job. Therefore, he was _ very hard six days a week as a third-class examiner in the Swiss patent office. During his free time, he produced four papers that upended _ . The first showed that light could be _ as waves, just as what our textbooks tell us today called optical wave. The second proved the _ 0f atoms and molecules. As we all know now, all the substance is made up of them. The third, the special theory of relativity, said that there was no such things as time or space. And the fourth noted equivalence between energy and mass. That is to say, there is a _ between energy and mass. Genius are _ , but not born. If one wants to amount to much, hardworking is the basis.", "options": [["holder", "creator", "winner", "maker"], ["idea", "improvement", "experiment", "theory"], ["vary", "un-change", "move", "speed"], ["adult", "child", "baby", "elder"], ["feared", "hoped", "thought", "realized"], ["fast", "slow", "clever", "normal"], ["consult", "examine", "see", "watch"], ["authority", "mother", "scientist", "headmaster"], ["official", "headmaster", "genius", "astronomer"], ["agree", "question", "criticize", "praise"], ["behavioral", "verbal", "mental", "physical"], ["speed", "space", "energy", "effect"], ["wanted", "stopped", "began", "tended"], ["accessed", "decided", "graduated", "progressed"], ["working", "studying", "researching", "living"], ["Chemistry", "Physics", "Biology", "Geography"], ["made", "monitored", "gathered", "imagined"], ["existence", "movement", "formation", "variety"], ["change", "balance", "loss", "increase"], ["produced", "created", "encouraged", "made"]], "answers": ["C", "D", "A", "B", "A", "B", "C", "D", "C", "B", "B", "B", "D", "C", "A", "B", "D", "A", "B", "D"]}
