{"article": "A friend of mine once told me a thing about his neighbor's bunny : One day he was sitting in the living room when his _ dragged a little \"gift\" in its mouth--a _ animal of some sort. Taking a closer look, he was nervous to _ the dead animal to be a bunny that belonged to a little girl who lived next door. Her name was Bonny. My friend felt _ , believing his cat had killed Bonny's bunny. My _ friend came up with a plan. Removing from the cat's mouth the dead animal, which by now was a dirty mess, he put it in the kitchen sink . With a little warm water, he tried to _ up the dead bunny as best as he could. Then he took a hair dryer and blow-dried the bunny _ it looked pretty good. Finally, he took the dead bunny out to the neighbor's bunny box and placed it back in the cage. He fluffed him up so that he looked very _ there in his little box. The next morning, my friend looked out of the window and noticed a crowd of people _ around the bunny box. Everyone seemed to be _ and pointing. My friend decided to go over and act like any normal curious _ and find out what was going on. When he got there, Bonny's mother said to my friend, \"You won't _ what has happened! It's a miracle! Bonny's bunny passed away a few days ago, and we buried that little bunny right over there.\" Have you ever tried to cover up one _ with another? Covering up only makes matters _ . Just like Bonny's bunny, the result is _ what we expected. We end up looking foolish. We will be better off admitting we were wrong and accepting the consequences.", "options": [["daughter", "cat", "son", "dog"], ["living", "clever", "lovely", "dead"], ["know", "hear", "recognize", "examine"], ["angry", "terrible", "happy", "lucky"], ["good-looking", "hard-working", "easy-going", "quick-thinking"], ["dress", "clean", "take", "hold"], ["when", "after", "before", "until"], ["natural", "secret", "strange", "funny"], ["looked", "walked", "stepped", "gathered"], ["worrying", "talking", "laughing", "shouting"], ["stranger", "friend", "neighbor", "workmate"], ["promise", "forget", "believe", "remind"], ["mistake", "action", "deed", "chance"], ["better", "important", "difficult", "worse"], ["always", "never", "often", "seldom"]], "answers": ["B", "D", "C", "B", "D", "B", "D", "A", "D", "B", "C", "C", "A", "D", "B"]}
