{"article": "When I come across a good essay in reading newspapers, I tend to cut and keep it. But just as I am about to do so I find the article on the _ side is as much interesting as the one. It may be a discussion of the way to _ in good health, or _ about how to behave and conduct oneself in society. If I cut the front essay, the opposite one is likely to _ damage, leaving out half of it _ keeping the text without the subject. As a result, the scissors would stay _ they start, or halfway done when I find out the regretful consequence. Sometimes two things are to be done at the same time, _ deserving your attention, you can only take up one of them, the other has to wait or be given up . But you know the future is unpredictable--the changed situation may not allow you to do what is _ behind. Thus your are caught in a fix and feel sad. How come that nice opportunities and brilliant _ should gather around all at once? It may happen that your life changes dramatically on your preference of one alternative to the other. In fact that is what _ is like: we are often _ with the two opposite aspects of a thing which are both _ like newspaper cutting. It often _ that our attention is drawn to one thing only after we are engaged in another. The _ may be more important than the latter. I still remember a philosopher's words: \"When one door shuts, another _ in life.\" So a casual or passive _ may not be a bad one. Whatever we do in our liftime, wherever life's storm tosses us , there _ be something we can achieve, some shore we can land, that opens up new visas to us. Don't forget God always keeps an alternative _ open for every one. While the front door is closed, there must be another open for you.", "options": [["first", "last", "front", "opposite"], ["keep", "get", "have", "make"], ["discussion", "problem", "advice", "way"], ["reduce", "suffer", "receive", "lead"], ["and", "or", "but", "how"], ["before", "after", "when", "until"], ["either", "neither", "nor", "both"], ["kept", "remained", "forgotten", "left"], ["ideas", "news", "attention", "ways"], ["future", "life", "work", "thing"], ["faced", "connected", "supplied", "accustomed"], ["interesting", "famous", "desirable", "funny"], ["seems", "occurs", "come", "appears"], ["beginner", "starter", "first", "former"], ["closes", "locks", "opens", "frees"], ["choice", "decision", "solution", "look"], ["might", "can", "may", "must"], ["window", "future", "door", "path"]], "answers": ["D", "A", "C", "B", "B", "A", "D", "D", "A", "B", "A", "C", "B", "D", "C", "A", "D", "C"]}
