{"article": "Across the world, students are working hard as they prepare for all kinds of exams. Many teenagers complain that while they do well in their homework, they don't get  _ marks in exams. They are wondering why. In a new study this month, U.S. psychologists think they have found the answer. Researchers report that heavy exam _ is actually more likely to affect the performance of very good students than average ones. Worried about whether they can _ others like parents and teachers, these students can lose their most _ intellectual weapon: short-term or working memory. This is their ability to _ numbers and ideas while finding solutions to the problem at hand. According to the study, when _ pressure is put on people with good skills, their performance drops off. People with strong working memory skills are very _ to do well in intellectual ability tests. Their analytical skills and creative _ depend on their short-term-focused processor . In the study, researchers _ the working memory of 93 students. They were divided into two groups, with a high and a low _ memory.  The students then took two maths tests each under _ conditions. One was called a practice test. In the other, the students were told they were part of a team that was depending on them to _ their score in order to win a reward.  The results showed _ differences: the group with high working memory scored about 10 percent higher than the others on the low-pressure practice test. But the two groups' _ were about equal on the other test when the pressure was higher.  The study shows how memory performance is _ by fear of failure and the ticking clock, according to the scientists.", "options": [["high", "low", "many", "poor"], ["contents", "result", "atmosphere", "pressure"], ["please", "disturb", "succeed", "fail"], ["worthless", "useless", "valuable", "expensive"], ["remember", "recall", "remind", "prepare"], ["extra", "ordinary", "little", "unusually"], ["possible", "probable", "determined", "likely"], ["labor", "experience", "thinking", "method"], ["tested", "checked", "researched", "examined"], ["storing", "working", "changing", "speaking"], ["unhealthy", "favorable", "hard", "different"], ["add", "develop", "rise", "improve"], ["expected", "significant", "unclear", "disappointing"], ["scores", "performances", "reports", "clocks"], ["prevented", "improved", "affected", "prepared"]], "answers": ["A", "D", "A", "C", "B", "A", "D", "C", "A", "B", "D", "D", "B", "A", "C"]}
