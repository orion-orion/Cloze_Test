{"article": "Are you still wishing your friends and partners \"Happy New Year\"? In the first few days of a new year, we say these three words countless times. The _ is that we say them almost without thinking. The result of such a wish is that it _ its meaning and power.  Last month, I _ Dada J P Vaswani's first speech after his return from the US. The _ of his speech was \"In 2012, all will be fine\". While sharing one of his many _ ideas, he said that while \"Happy New Year\" is a nice greeting, there's a more beautiful and encouraging way to _ others--\"Happy New You!\" Those three _ words show that New Year is a time to leave behind our _ and step forward. It's the time to renew ourselves by getting rid of the negative things of the past -- _ , pain and so on. It's also the right time to give up thoughts of fear and failure. For those who are _ what to change, Dada has a simple suggestion: write down all the things that you don't _ about yourself... every single one. They could be small or big, easy or difficult -- _ write them all down. Putting them on _ brings clearness of thought, which is the first step towards bringing about any change. So this New Year, let's wish each other \"Happy New You\" and then _ that trend all through the year. Each time you wish others, you will be _ not only them but also yourself to leave behind sadness and the past -- because it's time for being Happy and New.", "options": [["mind", "idea", "thought", "problem"], ["proves", "loses", "hides", "shows"], ["ruined", "remembered", "attended", "missed"], ["opinion", "design", "structure", "topic"], ["beautiful", "funny", "old", "normal"], ["surprise", "wish", "require", "disappoint"], ["short", "unusual", "exciting", "new"], ["friends", "dreams", "wishes", "disappointments"], ["anger", "calm", "excitement", "desire"], ["avoiding", "fearing", "forgetting", "wondering"], ["like", "think", "care", "ask"], ["still", "just", "sometimes", "never"], ["paper", "mind", "cloth", "bed"], ["explain", "continue", "improve", "check"], ["helping", "replacing", "reminding", "pleasing"]], "answers": ["D", "B", "C", "D", "A", "B", "C", "D", "A", "D", "A", "B", "A", "B", "C"]}
