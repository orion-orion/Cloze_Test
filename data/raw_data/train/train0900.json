{"article": "To Be Lucky,Be Prepared I remember the exact moment I learned the principle of preparing for luck. I was on the wrestling team. Now, if there's one thing I can tell you about any sports, it is that wrestling is probably the sport that has the least _ .

I remember on the bus on the way home, one of our teammates tried to _ John by saying, \"Oh, he just got lucky.\" And John said, \"That's so stupid.
