I found myself _ her, thinking about why she didn t _ four quarters down from her room with her, as if she had _ to be one short so she could ask someone else for it. (Later I knew _ that was not the case.) But I didn t have any reason to _ her. Then I responded, Yeah, I think I have the only one, though fully _ that I had three. Here you go, I said with a smile. Thanks, she responded, _ that she could have clean clothes to wear the next morning. A few moments later the girl _ and gave a dollar bill to me. Why are you giving this to me? I asked, _ . Oh, because you were kind to me, so I m just giving back the _ . It s just a dollar, but I felt it was _ .
