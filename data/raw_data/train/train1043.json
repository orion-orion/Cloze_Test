Later, in a bar, when I opened the first pack, I found - to my _ - the twenty cigarettes were there. I'm still at the bar, telephone in one _ and the cigarettes in the other. I'm dialing Shubentsov, who told me to call the moment I felt the urge to _ . I feel it, feel it even _ than I felt Shubentsov's healing energy. That's saying something, since Shubentsov is known around the world for _ smokers of their nasty habit, using a _ method.
