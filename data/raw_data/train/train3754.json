{"article": "I never know how well Mother could keep a trust until I was going through her things after she died. I discovered something I had _ forgotten, something that happened to me as a child. One night, as I lay in bed _ my sister and I had said our prayers, I recalled the events of the day and how _ I had behaved towards Mother. \"I must make things right before going to sleep,\" I thought. Quickly I slipped out of bed and picked up a pencil and paper, then tiptoed into the hall. The _ from the living room shone dimly. I knew Mother was downstairs mending socks. I quickly _ a note asking Mother to forgive me for being so _ . I didn't want my brothers and sisters to know our _ so I added a postscript: \"Please don't let anyone see this.\" Then I quietly moved into my parents' bedroom and put the letter under Mother's pillow. The next morning, when I _ my bed after breakfast, I unexpectedly _ a note under my pillow. Mother wrote that she loved me and _ me. This became my way of apologizing whenever I talked back or disobeyed. Mother always left a note, but she never spoke out our under-the-pillow messages in front of the family. Even when we were _ , she never mentioned them when we brothers and sister recalled our childhood.  When Mother passed away , I had to go through her personal belongings. In her desk was a bundle of notes tied with a faded ribbon . On top was a message in her handwriting. It read, \"In the event of my death, please _ these.\" I turned over the packet and glanced at the handwriting on the bottom. To my surprise, I _ my childish writing, \"P.S. Please don't let anyone see this. Love, Edie.\" I gently placed the unopened bundle in the wastebasket along with other things for the rubbish burner. \"Lord,\" I prayed, \"make me like my mother.\"", "options": [["long", "just", "never", "often"], ["before", "after", "until", "since"], ["well", "politely", "happily", "badly"], ["moon", "light", "candle", "thread"], ["designed", "sent", "wrote", "replaced"], ["artificial", "confident", "powerful", "naughty"], ["mistake", "business", "relation", "love"], ["searched", "selected", "made", "decorated"], ["issued", "rescued", "spotted", "attached"], ["missed", "understood", "supported", "forgave"], ["happy", "curious", "grown", "interested"], ["destroy", "keep", "hide", "read"], ["recognized", "lost", "realized", "liked"]], "answers": ["A", "B", "D", "B", "C", "D", "B", "C", "C", "D", "C", "A", "A"]}
