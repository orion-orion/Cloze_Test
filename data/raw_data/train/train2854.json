{"article": "I was 11 when you were born, and in your first few years I often looked after you, bathed and dressed you and took you out for walks. I have _ memories of your childhood. Of _ you up as a \"rock star\". Of watching you dance _ nightclothes. Of your insistence that I make your school lunch _ I put so much more peanut butter on your _ than anyone else. Of the _ phone call we ever had----an echo of my own university years--when you wanted to drop out of university and study dance. Since we have grown up, I have lived through you, although you may not know it. You had the opportunity I so _ wanted but never got ---- to train in the dancing arts. I encouraged our parents to support you because I have always _ how my life would be if they hadn't chosen a(n) _ career path for me, their eldest child. I know you have _ to hunt for work and confidence, and that you probably wonder sometimes if you made the right choice. _ , I am happy for you and proud that I played some small role in helping you to _ a dream. There is a _ between us now. It has grown since I first left home, and in the _ I missed your teenager years. That _ me greatly. I imagine that you believe we have very little in common--a dancer in the city and a biologist in West Africa---but in you I _ some of my own dreams realized. But beyond that, even at 12 or 13 I felt as much a mother to you as an older sister. So, on the rare _ when we see each other, I want to know everything, from your concerns, hopes to delights. I wish, there were an arm's _ between us. I hope we can one day be sisters or friends again.
