{"article": "I was born and raised in Minnesota, the USA, but as an adult I have mostly lived in Europe and Africa. I teach cross-cultural management at the International Business School near Paris. For the last 15 years, I've studied _ people in different parts of the world build trust, communicate and make decisions _ in the workplace. While travelling in Tokyo recently with a Japanese _ , I gave a shorttalk to a group of 20 managers. At the end , I asked whether there were any questions or comments.

He askedthe group again, \" Any comments or questions\". Still, no one raised a hand, _ this time he looked very carefully at each person in the silent audience. Gesturing to one of them, he said, \" Do you have _ to add?\" To my amazement, she _ \" Yes, thank you.\" and asked me a very interesting question. My colleague repeated this several times looking at the audience and asking for more questions or comments. After the session, I asked my colleague, \" How did you _ that those people had questions?\" He _ , not sure how to explain it, and then said, \" It has to do with how _ their eyes are.\" He continued, \"In Japan, we don't _ as much direct eye contact as you do in the west. So when you asked if there are any _ , most people were not looking directly at you. But a few people in the _ were looking right at you and their eyes were bright. That _ that they would be _ to have you call on them. I thought to myself I would ever have learned from upbringing in Minnesota.
