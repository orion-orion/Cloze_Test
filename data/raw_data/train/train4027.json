{"article": "\"So, how's your brother doing?\" Such a common question nowadays. I used to give long answers on what he was doing each day of the week, but now I just respond, \"He's fine.\" I've gotten _ of the question. While everyone wants to know how my brother is doing, no one _ asks me how I'm doing. I lived with him for over seventeen years of my life, and for some reason, no one thinks it would be _ for me to let him go. But it is. He was the _ of my world. My entire life went around him. I wore what he wore. If it was fifty degree outside, and he wore shorts, I _ wear shorts, too. I lived in my brother's _ for over seventeen years. He was popular with everyone. Before, I thought that people liked me. But no. People liked my brother. They were _ to him, and I just happened to be there. _ now, away from him, I'm facing a world so much bigger than before. He used to _ me from the brunt of the adult stuff, and I walked _ him, only seeing the nice stuff. But now I can see _ the world is really like. And I'm ready to _ it on my own. I may never be popular, but I can be friendly and make new friends. I'm ready to step out from his shadow and let my own shadow fall on the ground. Maybe they won't like me. _ , it's better than just being a copy of him. It's time to step out from behind his shadow. It's time to let the sun warm me up, instead of standing in my brother's cold shadow.", "options": [["disturbed", "frightened", "tired", "exhausted"], ["also", "just", "ever", "often"], ["easy", "hard", "happy", "sad"], ["sun", "teacher", "power", "center"], ["must", "should", "would", "might"], ["world", "reality", "protection", "shadow"], ["attached", "admitted", "sensitive", "attractive"], ["So", "And", "But", "Or"], ["protect", "prevent", "keep", "escape"], ["along", "behind", "around", "with"], ["which", "that", "how", "what"], ["explore", "live", "accept", "fight"], ["Instead", "Otherwise", "Besides", "Anyhow"]], "answers": ["C", "C", "B", "D", "C", "D", "A", "C", "A", "B", "D", "A", "D"]}
