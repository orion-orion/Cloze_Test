Once companies have attracted customers they often _ the second half of the story. In the excitement of beating off the competition, negotiating prices, securing orders, and delivering the product, managers tend to become carried away. They forget what they regard as the boring side of business --- _ that the customer remains a customer. _ to concentrate on retaining as well as attracting customers costs business huge amounts of money annually.
