{"article": ", , Dear son, The day that you see me old and I am already not in good health, have patience and try to understand me. If I get dirty when eating, if I can not dress, have patience and remember the hours I _ teaching it to you. If, when I speak to you, I _ the same things thousand and one times, do not _ me, listen to me. When you were small, I had to read to you thousand and one times the same story _ you got to sleep. When I do not want to have a _ , neither shame me nor scold me. Remember when I had to chase you with thousand excuses I _ , in order that you wanted to bathe. When you see my _ little about new technologies, give me the necessary time and do not look at me with your mocking smile. I taught you _ to do so many things: to eat good, to dress well, to confront life. When at some moment I lose the memory or the _ of our conversation, let me have the necessary time to remember, and if I cannot do it, do not become nervous, as the most important thing is not our conversation but surely to be with you and to have you _ to me. If ever I do not want to eat, do not force me. I know well _ I need to and when not. When my _ legs do not allow me to walk, give me your _ , the same way I did when you gave your first _ . And when someday I say to you that I do not want to _ any more that I want to rest forever, do not get angry. Someday you will understand. Try to understand that my age is not lived but survived. Some day you will discover that, _ my mistakes, I always wanted the _ thing for you and that I tried to prepare the way for you. You must not feel sad, or angry for seeing me _ you. You must be next to me, try to understand me and to help me as I did it when you _ living. Help me to walk, help me to end my way with love and _ . I will pay you by a smile and by the immense love I have had always for you. I love you, son.
