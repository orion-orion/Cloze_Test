I _ , everybody expects you to be special or _ , and I'm just an average student; and I'm average, too, when it comes to basketball, football, soccer, and baseball. I often wonder _ my father ever had a son like me. I mean he's so _ and so good at everything. So I would often dream about doing something amazing to _ my father and make him proud of me. In one class, my teacher _ a Father's Day essay contest for us and the winners' essays would be read in front of all the parents and students.
