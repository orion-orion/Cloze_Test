He told me despite being in debt , he was happy and _ that it was because of something he saw in India. A few years ago he was _ feeling sad and was touring India.He said right in front of his very eyes, he saw an Indian mother cut off her child's right hand with a knife.The helpless _ in the mother's eyes and the painful scream of the _ four-year-old child still remained in his mind. The _ mother made the child handicapped (disabled) so that he could go out on the streets to beg. _ by the scene, he dropped a small piece of bread he was eating.And almost at once, several children _ around this small piece of bread covered with sand, _ bits from one another.It was the _ reaction of hunger.He then went to the nearest bakery and bought every single loaf of bread. _ he gave out the bread to the children (mostly handicapped), he _ cheers and bows from these _ children.For the first time in his life, he understood _ people could give up their _ for a loaf of bread.He came to _ how fortunate he was to be able to have a sound body, have a job, have a family, have the chance to _ about food that didn't taste good, and have the many things that these people in front of him _ dreamed of having.Perhaps life wasn't bad at all.", "options": [["explained", "recalled", "mentioned", "insisted"], ["certainly", "really", "seriously", "absolutely"], ["expression", "despair", "impression", "anger"], ["guilty", "tiresome", "innocent", "numb"], ["merciless", "upset", "desperate", "crazy"], ["Puzzled", "Attracted", "Disgusted", "Shocked"], ["gathered", "looked", "sat", "turned"], ["sharing", "taking", "offering", "giving"], ["mental", "physical", "natural", "emotional"], ["Since", "Until", "If", "As"], ["received", "accepted", "heard", "rejected"], ["polite", "unfortunate", "energetic", "greedy"], ["whom", "what", "how", "when"], ["honor", "identity", "morals", "dignity"], ["acknowledge", "realize", "conclude", "recognize"], ["complain", "comment", "argue", "decide"], ["even", "ever", "never", "hardly"]], "answers": ["A", "B", "A", "C", "C", "D", "A", "B", "C", "D", "A", "B", "C", "D", "B", "A", "C"]}
