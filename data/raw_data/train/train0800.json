{"article": "I read a piece of news today that the richest people were paying 736, 000 dollars for watches at present. As I was _ my head at their craziness, I glanced at my own 8-dollar watch. It told me the time just fine. I guessed that about 735, 992 dollars were left over from buying such a cheap watch. With that I could send 18 kids to college for four years each with the room, board, and books included. With that I could sponsor _ 200 needy children overseas into adulthood. With that I could buy _ for 2.5 million starving people around the world. With that money I could do so much good, help so many souls, and still know the _ whenever I looked down at my wrist. When did our society become so _ that anyone would think they needed a 736, 000-dollar watch? When did people become so _ that they would believe a one-million-dollar _ is essential? My first car cost me only 500 dollars and it still gets me where I need to go. When did 50-million-dollar yachts and 100-million-dollar houses become so _ to a person's happiness? My tiny home has more 25 _ in it than the biggest mansion in the world and I can walk on the shore of the local lake here and _ its beauty for free. I pray that at some point our society says \"Enough!\" and wakes up from this horrible dream of materialism. Each of us only has one life. Let's not _ it on the watches we wear and the cars we drive. Each of us only has one soul. Let's not _ it trying to gain the whole world. Life puts us here to love each other and to make this world a better place. Help others whenever you can. Life is brief and no watch will sell a(n) _ second of it to you.", "options": [["hiding", "nodding", "raising", "shaking"], ["nearly", "hardly", "wisely", "easily"], ["meals", "houses", "books", "clothes"], ["watch", "world", "people", "time"], ["rich", "crazy", "generous", "proud"], ["shallow", "well-dressed", "annoying", "enthusiastic"], ["watch", "boat", "flat", "car"], ["accessible", "vital", "uncommon", "powerful"], ["members", "furniture", "joy", "sorrow"], ["enjoy", "benefit", "include", "amuse"], ["spend", "waste", "hold", "consume"], ["own", "hurt", "ignore", "lose"], ["quick", "precious", "extra", "simple"]], "answers": ["D", "A", "A", "D", "B", "A", "D", "B", "C", "A", "B", "D", "C"]}
