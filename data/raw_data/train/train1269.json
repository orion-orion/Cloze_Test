{"article": "My husband, a simple man, has a favorite saying: \"A bargain is really a bargain when you don't buy it\". _ he sets aside his simple ways when we dine out. Unlike his relatives who enter a restaurant armed with calculators to make sure they never _ , my husband _ 5 percent each time the accepted tip standard increases. He hasn't analyzed why he tips so generously, but I think the habit _ from his high school years, when he worked as a busboy and got tips from people he served. Over the years, out growing boys would suggest that Dad let them _ dessert rather than tip so much. He stood firm _ their strong demands. Our sons and I have _ to accept his habit. We recently _ our son's girlfriend to seafood. We chose a restaurant near Cocoa Beach. Our server, a grandmotherly woman _ at the artof service, flew around the restaurant serving dishes and drinks _ treating customers enthusiastically. She remembered their special _ , likes and dislikes. She didn't serve us _ food. She served us the best food. She made sure the kitchen gave her fresh produce. At the end of the meal, our waitress _ the bill, then went to _ to the growing crowd of other diners. My husband paid with a credit card and added her tip. When we left, \"Mr. Goldsmith!\"she called waving a receipt at him, \"Thank you.\" \"What did you give her?\"I asked, wondering if he had done something _ or made acalculation error. \"She gave us great service. I just thought she deserved a big _ in tips.It wasn't until later when I overheard our son retelling the story of the grateful waitress that I realized she had given my family something _ a thank you. She showed our son the _ of recognizing hard work. Her show of gratitudehelped a dad earn a bit more _ from a loving son. And it reminded me just why I married this _ , caring man.", "options": [["Therefore", "Yet", "Instead", "Besides"], ["overtip", "overspend", "overcharge", "overwaste"], ["adds", "supplies", "refuses", "provides"], ["developed", "resulted", "appeared", "changed"], ["order", "choose", "book", "ask"], ["for", "to", "against", "upon"], ["decided", "agreed", "come", "happened"], ["helped", "requested", "treated", "cooked"], ["quick", "familiar", "weak", "skilled"], ["sothat", "after", "with", "while"], ["characters", "features", "tastes", "favorites"], ["cheap", "special", "average", "delicious"], ["presented", "took", "delivered", "settled"], ["turn", "talk", "wait", "attend"], ["demanding", "ashamed", "unreasonable", "puzzling"], ["rise", "reward", "pay", "prize"], ["littlemorethan", "morethan", "ratherthan", "otherthan"], ["importance", "situation", "meaning", "effort"], ["attention", "care", "praise", "respect"], ["easy-going", "thoughtful", "tough", "serious"]], "answers": ["B", "A", "A", "B", "A", "C", "C", "C", "D", "D", "C", "C", "A", "D", "C", "A", "B", "A", "D", "B"]}
