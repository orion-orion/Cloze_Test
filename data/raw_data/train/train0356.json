The Quicksilver Invitation surfing competition had to be _ . The waves were just too big.   But on that same late-January day, ly unknown big-wave rider Greg Russ had to be physically _ by lifeguards from launching out into the biggest surf in more than a decade. The guards were interfering with his right to make _ , he said.   The incentive: $50,000 from the surf-equipment manufacturer K2 to anyone who can ride the biggest wave of the year and get it on film .  From ice climbing to mountain biking to big-wave surfing, more people are becoming extreme athletes, putting their lives in danger for the _ thrill.

For example, the number of climbers _ to climb Alaska's 20,300-foot Mt.
