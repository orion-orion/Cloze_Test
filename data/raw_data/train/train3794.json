{"article": "It was the golden season. I could see the yellow leaves falling with the cool wind. For others, it is a/an _ season, while for me, it is an annoying season. Tired from preparing for Postgraduate Entrance Examination, I decided to have a _ along the Yanjiang Road in my university. \"Autumn is a lonely season and life is _ . The days in this season always get me down \", I was in deep thought when the sound of a guitar _ into my ears, like a stream flowing from the mountains. I was so surprised that I ran to see what it was. A young girl, sitting on the lawn, was _ in playing her guitar. The music was so attractive that I listened quietly. Lost in the music, I did not realize that I had been standing for so long. But my _ did not seem to disturb her. Leaves were still falling. Every day when I passed by the lawn, I would see her playing her guitar. During the rest of the days in the season, life became interesting and I could go over the courses carefully. Though we did not know each other, I thought we were always good friends. Autumn was nearly over. One day, when I was listening _ , the sound suddenly stopped. To my astonishment, the girl came _ to me. \"You must like the music,\" she said. \"Yes, you play very well. Why did you stop?\" I asked. Suddenly, a _ expression appeared on her face and I could feel something unusual. \"I came here just to have a rest because I failed in the college entrance examination. I felt very disappointed. And it was your listening every day _ encouraged me,\" she said, \"and I have to go tomorrow.\" \" In reality , it was your playing that gave me a meaningful autumn and helped me believe that I have the ability to pass the Postgraduate Entrance Examination.\" I answered, \"I think it was God who gave us the chance to know each other and we should be good friends She smiled and I smiled. Since then, I have never seen her again. I no longer passed by that _ . Only thick leaves were _ behind. But I will always remember the _ of the girl. It was her appearance that helped me passed the Postgraduate Entrance Examination. We may encounter many people in our lives. Some are like a shooting star, but give off so much light that they guide you in the correct _ ; some are like _ in you, they are always with you, but do not understand you. Just as a famous saying, many people _ in your life, but only true friends leave footprints. I shall always _ the autumn, the girl and the sound of her guitar. I know she will always be my best friend.", "options": [["irrigation", "harvest", "rainfall", "adventure"], ["walk", "nap", "rest", "glance"], ["stressful", "aimless", "uninteresting", "desperate"], ["flowed", "floated", "flew", "fled"], ["devoted", "addicted", "engaged", "absorbed"], ["exposure", "movement", "existence", "enthusiasm"], ["casually", "devotedly", "roughly", "thoroughly"], ["along", "down", "over", "back"], ["strange", "happy", "special", "sad"], ["when", "which", "that", "what"], ["mountain", "stream", "road", "lawn"], ["left", "thrown", "fallen", "piled"], ["figure", "face", "hair", "eyes"], ["direction", "destination", "position", "situation"], ["clothes", "shadows", "footprints", "wrists"], ["broke", "stepped", "approached", "participated"], ["remind", "review", "remain", "recall"]], "answers": ["B", "A", "C", "A", "D", "C", "B", "C", "D", "C", "D", "A", "A", "A", "A", "B", "D"]}
