{"article": "How often do you let other people's nonsense change your mood? Do you let a bad driver, impolite waiter, rude boss, or an insensitive employee _ your day? One day I was in a taxi and we headed _ the airport. We were driving in the right lane _ suddenly a black car drove out of a parking space right in front of us. My taxi driver slammed on his brakes, slide sideways, and at the very last moment our car stopped and narrowly _ the other car by just inches!The driver of the other car looked around and started _ at us. My taxi driver just _ and waved at the guy. And I mean he was really _ . So I asked, \"Why did you just do that? This guy almost ruined your car and sent us to the hospital!\"This is when my taxi driver taught me what I now call \"The Law of the Garbage Truck\". He _ that many people are like garbage trucks. They run around full of _ , full of frustration, full of anger, and full of disappointment. As their garbage _ up, they need a place to dump it and sometimes they'll dump it on _ . Don't take it personally. Just smile, wave, wish them well, and move on. Believe me. You'll be more _ . Don't take their garbage and _ it to other people at work, at home, or on the streets, Life's too short to wake up in the morning with _ . The mark of your success is how quickly you can refocus on what's _ in your life. Roy Baumeister, a psychology researcher from Florida State University, found in his extensive research that you _ bad things more often than good things in your life. You store the bad memories rather easily, and you _ them more frequently. So...Love the people who treat you right. Ignore the ones who don't. Life is ten percent what you make it and ninety percent how you _ it! When you follow \"The Law of the Garbage Truck\", you take back control of your life. You make room for the good by _ go of the bad. Have a Garbage Free Day!Have a marvelous, garbage-free day!The seeds you plant today _ the harvest you reap tomorrow.", "options": [["injure", "ruin", "hurt", "harm"], ["through", "from", "in", "for"], ["while", "when", "since", "as"], ["knocked", "overtook", "missed", "left"], ["laughing", "throwing", "glancing", "yelling"], ["wondered", "smiled", "ignored", "guessed"], ["friendly", "angry", "frightened", "disappointed"], ["showed", "suggested", "explained", "hated"], ["expectation", "passengers", "garbage", "goods"], ["turns", "pushes", "holds", "piles"], ["roads", "children", "you", "dustbins"], ["healthy", "happy", "pitiful", "wealthy"], ["spread", "share", "explain", "contribute"], ["surprise", "pleasure", "doubt", "regrets"], ["funny", "important", "strange", "embarrassing"], ["remember", "forget", "value", "appreciate"], ["enjoy", "exchange", "recall", "imagine"], ["inspire", "take", "mend", "notice"], ["letting", "consisting", "making", "dreaming"], ["distinguish", "deserve", "deliver", "determine"]], "answers": ["B", "D", "B", "C", "D", "B", "A", "C", "C", "D", "C", "B", "A", "D", "B", "A", "C", "B", "A", "D"]}
