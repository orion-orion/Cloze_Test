She didn't accept the request, but a quick browse through the girl's friends list revealed the names of dozens of kids from her _ . Many of the students' Facebook pages were completely _ , meaning even strangers could search through the kids' personal photos and messages. \"I saw middle fingers, students dressed inappropriately, and extremely _ language,\" Melissa says. \"It was _ .\" When she brought up her _ in class, the students were not _ at all. So she created a _ of her own. With a bright green marker pen, she wrote on a piece of paper: \"Dear Facebook: my 12yearold students think it is 'no big deal ' that they are posting pictures of themselves... Please help me show them how _ their images can get around.\" She put a picture of the letter on her Facebook page and asked people to _ it. In hours, it was shared 108,000 times across dozens of states and four countries. She _ it after eight hours, but it continued to spread. \"I wanted to _ them that it's on the Internet forever,\" she says. As she explained the results of her _ in class, the students' eyes got bigger and bigger. \"It scared a few of them into deleting their pages _ ,\" she says. Others have removed inappropriate posts and used privacy settings to _ their pages. Her _ wasn't to scare them off social media but to push them to be _ of what they post. Melissa says, \"I tell them, 'It doesn't _ you have to just because everyone else is sharing.'\"", "options": [["invitation", "demand", "order", "request"], ["family", "college", "classroom", "company"], ["public", "famous", "secret", "unknown"], ["proper", "polite", "simple", "rude"], ["despairing", "comforting", "disturbing", "exciting"], ["result", "discovery", "suggestion", "wish"], ["worried", "satisfied", "pleased", "disappointed"], ["post", "picture", "article", "news"], ["urgently", "quickly", "slowly", "badly"], ["know", "deliver", "share", "say"], ["prevented", "kept", "copied", "deleted"], ["promise", "persuade", "show", "ask"], ["experiment", "lesson", "study", "research"], ["only", "completely", "recently", "hardly"], ["display", "create", "manage", "print"], ["mention", "intention", "question", "imagination"], ["mindful", "fearful", "skilful", "thoughtful"], ["matter", "work", "count", "mean"]], "answers": ["D", "C", "A", "D", "C", "B", "A", "A", "B", "C", "D", "C", "A", "B", "C", "B", "A", "D"]}
