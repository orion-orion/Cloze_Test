{"article": "I have been applying, interviewing, etc since July with no prospects . I have been told mostly that I am overqualified, or they need fulltime etc. I had been getting pretty down and discouraged. I was actually asking myself why can't someone be kind enough to take me on as an _ . This past Tuesday evening it was freezing cold outside and going to be 9 pm as I was waiting at a bus stop. Just as the bus pulled up a young woman approached me. She had a T-shirt, Capri pants, and slippers on. She also was wearing several hospital bracelets. I dug in my purse and took out $5.00 so she could get something to eat. I then took off my jacket and tennis shoes and gave them to her. I said, \"These are a little big but they should keep _ warm.\" She looked at me and said \"Aren't you going to be cold?\" I told her my being cold for 15 minutes _ I got to my place was worth it if I knew she would be a little warmer. She sobbed and thanked me with a hug. I just told her to pass it on . Then after I got on the bus that's _ the miracle of spreading _ happened. I stepped up to pay the _ and the bus driver said, \"Mam, I saw what you just did and your fare is _ me, even though technically we aren't supposed to let you get on the bus without shoes.\" he said with a wink. A lady who was dressed in a very _ business suit called me over to her seat. She said, \"I want to know the _ of the person who just did the most _ thing I have ever seen.\" I told her my name and she said , \"What can I do for you to _ what I just witnessed?\" I _ said a paying job would be nice. The next day she called me and said that she had a _ administrative assistant position _ in her company and wanted me to meet with the manager. It turned out that the lady was the head Human Resources person. I start Monday morning at 9am! Thank you all for inspiring me to keep passing the kindness on! I never expected to get so much back in return!", "options": [["engineer", "entertainer", "employee", "employer"], ["her", "him", "you", "me"], ["until", "before", "after", "since"], ["where", "why", "when", "how"], ["luck", "kindness", "generosity", "mercy"], ["ticket", "fare", "money", "check"], ["to", "for", "on", "with"], ["informal", "casual", "professional", "practical"], ["job", "address", "religion", "name"], ["inspiring", "courageous", "amazing", "grateful"], ["praise", "repay", "appreciate", "admire"], ["seriously", "eagerly", "hopefully", "jokingly"], ["part-time", "tough", "simple", "novel"], ["empty", "open", "offer", "opportunity"]], "answers": ["C", "C", "B", "C", "B", "A", "C", "C", "D", "A", "B", "D", "A", "B"]}
