The _ companies make robots for teaching people, and now they have realized that there is a need for small, _ robots that they can meet.

The major cost of making _ their models is the electronics, which will fall in price. There is _ scope for reductions in mechanical costs. The use of standard parts,which are easily replaced, should give these robots a mechanical life of something in the order of five years.", "options": [["small", "educational", "big", "business"], ["claimed", "called", "thought", "told"], ["to", "with", "over", "in"], ["money", "discounts", "prices", "costs"], ["exciting", "encouraging", "satisfying", "disappointing"], ["ourselves", "customers", "companies", "us"], ["to", "for", "in", "with"], ["custom", "literacy", "poem", "tradition"], ["However", "Finally", "Whereas", "Because"], ["capable", "possible", "probable", "available"], ["compared", "comparing", "contrasted", "contrasting"], ["than", "above", "over", "from"], ["took", "robots", "machines", "electronics"], ["other", "big", "little", "robot"], ["expensive", "artificial", "educational", "low-cost"], ["mechanical", "standard", "cheap", "small"], ["much", "many", "both", "some"], ["more", "less", "no", "least"]], "answers": ["A", "D", "B", "D", "A", "B", "C", "B", "D", "B", "B", "B", "B", "B", "A", "C", "B", "B"]}
