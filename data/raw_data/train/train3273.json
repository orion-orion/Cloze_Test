{"article": "When traveling in the Canadian Rockies by car, I often notice a road sign that says, \"A fed bear is a dead bear.\" In the beginning , I did not get it. Why is a fed bear a dead one?

When winter came, fewer travelers took to the mountains, which _ less food for the bears, some of whom starved or frozen to death. So the Canadian government put up warning signs along the road, essentially advising people not to feed the bears. This reminded me of a scientific experiment. Some white mice were _ into two groups. One group spent their days only eating and sleeping, _ the other, fed only with half the amount of food _ , had to search for food. Half a year later, scientists found that the mice that had to search for their own food were _ , while the fully fed ones were either ill or dead. It was _ that the underfed white mice, in the _ of searching for their food, had kept healthy by exercising in finding food, being adaptable, and _ their immunity . Many over-concerned parents are feeding their children like _ or white mice. At present, children are only good at reading and studying, and are not encouraged to think independently and act for themselves. _ placed in strange environments, they are lost, confused, and helpless.
