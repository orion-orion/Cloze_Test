{"article": "Once upon a time when I was young,I watched fearfully as my little brother was caught in the act. He sat in the comer of the living room, a pen in one hand and my father's new _ in the other. As our father walked into the room,my brother cowered slightly; he sensed that he had done something _ . He had scribbled on the first page with the pen. Now,he and I both waited for our father's punishment. And as we waited, there was no way we could have known that he was about to _ us one of his deep and lasting lessons about life and family,lessons that continue to become _ clearer to me through the years. My father picked up his book and looked at it carefully without saying a word. Books were _ to him. For him,books were knowledge,and _ he loved his children. What he did next was remarkable . Instead of _ my brother,instead of scolding him,he _ the pen from my brother's hand and then wrote in the book _ :\"John's work,1959,age 2. Thank God for the one who has just _ in my new book. You have made the book sacred.\"  The years and the books came and _ ,Our family expe rienced everything that 0ther families. went through .
