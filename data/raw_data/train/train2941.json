{"article": "Friday What do you think, Daddy? The English instructor said that my last paper _ an unusual amount of originality. She did, truly. Those were her _ . It doesn't seem possible, does it, _ the eighteen years of training that I've had? The _ of the John Grier Home is to turn the ninety-seven orphans into ninety-seven twins.  The unusual artistic ability which I _ was developed at an early age through drawing chalk pictures of Mrs. Lippett on the door.  I hope that I don't hurt your feelings when I take a _ to the home of my youth? But you have the upper hand, you know, for _ I become too impolite, you can always stop payment of your cheques. That isn't a very polite thing to say--but you can't _ me to have any manners; a foundling asylum isn't a young ladies' finishing school.  You know, Daddy, it isn't the work that is going to be 44 _ in college. It's the play. Half the time I don't know _ the girls are talking about; their jokes seem to relate to a past that everyone _ me has shared. I'm a foreigner in the world and I don't _ the language. It's a miserable feeling. I've had it all my life. At the high school the girls _ stand in groups and just look at me. I was _ and everybody knew it. I could FEEL 'John Grier Home' written on my face. And then a few kindly ones would make a point of coming up and saying something _ . I HATED EVERY ONE OF THEM--the kindly ones most of all. Nobody here knows that I was 51 brought up in an asylum. I told Sallie McBride that my mother and father were _ , and that a kind old gentleman was sending me to college which is _ true, so far as it goes. I don't want you to think I am a coward , but I do want to be like the other girls, and that Dreadful Home is the one great big difference. If I can _ my back on that and shut out the remembrance, I think, I might be just as _ as any other girl. I don't believe there's any real, underneath difference, do you? Anyway, Sallie McBride likes me!
