{"article": "When I was in college twenty-five years ago, I spent four summers working in _ at a luxury hotel in downtown Chicago. In other words , I was a maid. I did not enter the world of housekeeping enthusiastically. My friends had _ jobs such as making ice cream, selling goods at the mall, or life guarding at the outdoor pool. I had been hoping to get a job as an office lady for a famous company: _ pay, air-conditioned office, the gold standard for summer jobs, as most of us dreamed of. When that fell through , the only option left was to take a train ride downtown each morning to work as a maid. It was tiring work, cleaning up to eighteen rooms a day. My _ attitude reflected my disdain for cleaning toilets, _ bed sheets, dusting, eight hours a day for the comfort of total strangers who _ left a tip. I thought it was beneathme. My maid work was average _ the day I was assigned to the eighteenth floor. That was Lorena's regular floor. The only time another maid set foot on it was on Lorena's day off. If you left any water _ on the mirror, or a hair on the bed, Lorena would hunt you down when she _ , as I found out firsthand. She'd ended her lecture to me with \" _ some pride in your work.\" She did. And so did Rosalie, Helen, Annette, and all the other experienced maids. Their devotion to doing a good job and their belief that their work was a _ of their character stuck with me throughout my _ career after graduation. I learned a lot from them during those four summers. Not a week would go without one of them _ some firm but friendly advice: \"Where's your commode brush? You don't have one? How do you expect to get that bowl clean?\" Their pride in a job well done was reflected in how they treated _ . They left the building at the end of the day in nice dresses and _ makeup. They looked like they could have been attending an afternoon tea. And, _ often, they were smiling and laughing, cheerfully greeting their co-workers a good evening. When you work with happiness and _ , a job will be well done. I believe there is _ in any job if you work hard and try your best.", "options": [["cleaning", "housekeeping", "serving", "managing"], ["winter", "summer", "awful", "permanent"], ["extra", "poor", "average", "good"], ["negative", "right", "excellent", "casual"], ["making", "spreading", "changing", "doing"], ["frequently", "rarely", "occasionally", "willingly"], ["when", "after", "until", "before"], ["drops", "signs", "tracks", "marks"], ["visited", "arrived", "left", "returned"], ["take", "obtain", "reject", "make"], ["reflection", "truth", "gratitude", "award"], ["special", "general", "different", "professional"], ["taking", "following", "offering", "refusing"], ["others", "themselves", "customers", "co-workers"], ["expensive", "cautious", "cheap", "careful"], ["more", "least", "most", "less"], ["frustration", "regret", "prejudice", "satisfaction"], ["respect", "aspect", "challenge", "failure"]], "answers": ["B", "B", "D", "A", "C", "B", "C", "D", "D", "A", "A", "D", "C", "B", "D", "C", "D", "A"]}
