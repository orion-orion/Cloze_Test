{"article": "Most people make tree houses using a pile of wood, a hammer, and some nails. Mitchell Joachim, an architect from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has a(n) _ vision. He pictures a day when homes will be created from living trees . Joachim's vision is based on an idea called pleaching , where tree branches are grown so that they _ weave together. Since the growth patterns of trees are _ by wind and sunlight, it may be _ to control the way a tree develops. These Fabricated Tree House Habitats would use trees grown into shapes as housing. One of the _ of these designs is that trees would not have to be cut down for wood . \"A 100 percent tree houses would take years to create,\" Joachim said. Depending on the climate, a house could take anywhere from 5 to 30 years to grow. Fortunately, there's a way to speed up the process. Joachim suggests including _ materials such as sod , grasses and living branches in the housing designs. \"This material would be able to move _ the house grows,\" Joachim said. A home would become an actual ecosystem. The trees would also give off water vapor that would assist in _ the homes. Solar panels and wind would help provide _ .The tree homes might even have soil pockets, _ plants could grow from the structure itself. Work has already _ on Joachim's first design--a house made from 15 percent recycled and 15 percent living things. Joachim is confident about the _ of his work, as he uses natural products without destroying nature. \"The environment and its study are very important. We need to respect nature, don't take it for granted ,\" he said.", "options": [["similar", "excellent", "strange", "different"], ["luckily", "naturally", "partly", "separately"], ["effected", "affected", "attempted", "intended"], ["possible", "impossible", "important", "necessary"], ["designers", "purposes", "disadvantages", "advantages"], ["compound", "chemical", "ecological", "industrial"], ["for", "as", "so", "because"], ["cleaning", "heating", "cooling", "lighting"], ["food", "energy", "beauty", "charming"], ["where", "which", "that", "and"], ["stopped", "completed", "controlled", "begun"], ["pleasure", "happiness", "benefit", "importance"]], "answers": ["D", "B", "B", "A", "D", "C", "B", "C", "B", "A", "D", "D"]}
