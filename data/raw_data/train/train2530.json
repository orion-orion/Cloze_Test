{"article": "\"You can learn English more efficiently if you spend 20 minutes a day for a week than if you spend two hours a day.\" This is what a teacher usually says when he tells his students how to allot their time. But is it true? Suppose you have a bucket _ a small hole in its bottom. Now you are asked to fill up the bucket with the water in a basin. If you are too little a boy to lift the basin full of water, you are sure to make use of a bowl or something alike. You will dip out the water from the basin with the bowl and _ it into the bucket. You may dip from the basin again and again. However, you will soon _ that as soon as you pour (;) a bowl of water into the bucket, most of the water leaks out through the _ , so you are _ able to fill up the bucket this way. On the contrary, if you are an adult, you will undoubtedly _ the basin and pour the whole basin of water into the bucket at once. Now, the bucket is full. Though the water in it is also leaking out, you at least have filled up the bucket with water. If you want to keep the bucket full, you only _ add a bowl of water now and then. The same is true of English learning. Let us take a simple example. If you learn 10 new words today, you are most likely to remember nine _ . But if you try to learn 30 words today, though you may forget _ more than one word, you may still be able to remember 11 or 12 words tomorrow. Day in and day _ , you will be able to remember a large number of words, _ you may forget some of them. In short, the more time you spend at a time, the more you will learn on the whole. Of course, the amount of time you spend each time must be _ the limit that you do not exhaust yourself .", "options": [["with", "on", "about", "in"], ["throw", "pour", "dip", "catch"], ["see", "watch", "look", "find"], ["hole", "bowl", "bucket", "basin"], ["easily", "slowly", "never", "fast"], ["put", "rise", "place", "lift"], ["can", "need", "must", "may"], ["yesterday", "tomorrow", "ago", "before"], ["bit", "little", "fairly", "far"], ["away", "out", "ago", "before"], ["but", "though", "however", "because"], ["in", "within", "among", "inside"]], "answers": ["A", "B", "D", "A", "C", "D", "B", "B", "D", "B", "B", "B"]}
