{"article": "Many years ago, I went to pick up my mother from work in the afternoon. I got there a little early so I parked the car by the road and waited for her. As I looked outside the car window to my right, there was a small park where I _ a little boy, around one and a half to two years old, _ freely on the grass as his mother watched from a short distance. The boy had a big smile on his face as if he had just been set free from some sort of prison. The boy would then fall to the grass, get up, and without _ or without looking back at his mother, run as fast as he could, again, still with a smile on his face. It seemed _ had happened! For kids, _ at an early age, when they fall down, they don't regard their falling down as a _ ;instead, they treat it as a learning experience. They feel compelled to try and try again until they succeed. The answer must be that they have not _ \"falling down\" with the word \"failure\" yet, thus they don' t know how to feel the state which accomparues failure. Therefore, they are not _ in any way. In addition, they probably think to themselves that it's perfectly okay to fall down, and that it's not wrong to do so. In other words , they give themselves permission to make mistakes. Thus they remain energetic. Touched as I was by the boy's _ , I was equally touched by the manner in which he ran. With each attempt, he looked so _ and natural. No _ of fear and nervousness. His only aim was to run freely and to do it as _ as he could. He was just being a child-just being himself - being completely in the moment. He was not looking for _ or was not worrying about whether someone was _ or not. He wasn't concerned about being judged. He didn't seem to be bothered by the fact that maybe someone would see him fall ( as there were others in the park apart from him and his mother) and that it would be _ if he did fall. No, all that _ to him was to accomplish the task or activity at hand to the best of his ability. To run and to feel the experience of running fully and freely. I _ a lot from that observation and experience, and have successfully brought that lesson with me in my many pursuits in life.", "options": [["realized", "understood", "saw", "helped"], ["marching", "walking", "running", "moving"], ["hesitation", "competition", "situation", "motivation"], ["everything", "something", "anything", "nothing"], ["especially", "specially", "generally", "normally"], ["success", "failure", "shame", "pity"], ["announced", "abandoned", "assumed", "associated"], ["encouraged", "shocked", "discouraged", "excited"], ["faith", "honesty", "persistence", "loyalty"], ["upset", "calm", "enthusiastic", "confident"], ["symbols", "signs", "signals", "marks"], ["effectively", "imaginatively", "relatively", "negatively"], ["explanation", "approval", "curiosity", "opinion"], ["listening", "glaring", "watching", "enjoying"], ["embarrassing", "amazing", "confusing", "thrilling"], ["referred", "came", "contributed", "mattered"], ["won", "learned", "made", "knew"]], "answers": ["C", "C", "A", "D", "A", "B", "D", "C", "C", "D", "B", "A", "B", "C", "A", "D", "B"]}
