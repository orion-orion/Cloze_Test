{"article": "That cold January night, I was growing sick of my life in San Francisco. There I was, walking home at one in the morning after a tiring _ at the theatre. With opening night only a week away, I was _ learning my lines. I was having trouble dealing with my part-time job at the bank and my acting at night at the same time. As I walked, I thought seriously _ giving up both acting and San Francisco. City life had become too much for me. As I walked down _ streets under tall buildings, I felt very _ and cold. I began running, both to keep warm and to keep away from any possible robbers. Very few people were still out except a few sad-looking homeless people under blankets.
