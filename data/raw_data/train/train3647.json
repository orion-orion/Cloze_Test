{"article": "As a young social worker in a New York City psychiatric clinic, I was asked to see Roz, a 20-year-old woman who had been referred to us from another psychiatric clinic. It was an _ referral in that no information was received ahead of her first appointment. I was told to \"play it by ear\", and to figure out what her problems were and what she needed. _ an examination to go on, I saw Roz as an unhappy, misunderstood young woman who hadn't been listened to in her earlier treatment. Her family situation was unpleasant. I didn't see her as disturbed, _ rather as lonely and misunderstood. She responded so _ to being heard. I encouraged her to start a life worth living -- to find a job, a satisfying place to live and new relationships. We hit it off well, and she _ making important changes in her life. The records from the previous psychiatric clinic arrived a month after Roz and I began our successful work together. To my complete surprise, her records were several inches thick, _ a long period of psychiastric hospitalization. Her diagnosis was \"paranoid schizophrenic \", with a _ that she was \"hopeless\". That had not been my experience with Roz at all so I decided to forget those pieces of paper. I never treated her as if she had that \"hopeless\" treatment. I did find out about the horrors for Roz of the hospitalization, of being drugged, separated and abused. I also learned a lot from her about _ such deeply and unforgettably shocking circumstances. First Roz found a job, then a place to live away from her difficult _ . After several months of working together, she introduced me to her husband-to-be, a successful businessman who adored her. When we _ our treatment, Roz gave me the gift of a silver bookmark and a note that said, \"Thank you for believing and encouraging me.\"", "options": [["uncertain", "unfortunate", "unconscious", "unusual"], ["On", "Without", "From", "In"], ["then", "but", "still", "and"], ["slowly", "briefly", "effectively", "positively"], ["delayed", "resisted", "started", "avoided"], ["requiring", "describing", "repeating", "reporting"], ["comment", "suggestion", "note", "decision"], ["surviving", "improving", "mastering", "explaining"], ["clinic", "house", "job", "family"], ["shared", "conducted", "completed", "received"]], "answers": ["D", "B", "B", "D", "C", "B", "A", "A", "D", "C"]}
