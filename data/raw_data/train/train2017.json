{"article": "In 1971, readers around the world were astonished by some photographs which appeared in newspapers. Hidden deep in the rainforests of an island in the Philippines, was an ethnic _ called the Tasaday. Not until that moment did anyone have any _ of these people. They didn't have an agricultural economy; they hunted animals and _ fruit from the plants in the rainforest. They carried tools made of stone, lived in _ and wore clothes made of leaves. Unknown until 1971, they _ became world famous. After that, there were TV _ and books about them; people said their simple lives showed that human beings could be good and kind if they were not _ by modern life. Then after 1974 the region was closed by the government and the world _ about them. In 1986, a Swiss journalist, Oswald Iten, decided to visit the Tasaday. The journey _ thick rainforests and across rivers was hard and dangerous. Mr. Iten was _ killed by the soldiers, villagers and businessmen who wanted to take the wood from the rainforest. Finally, Mr. Iten _ and found the caves of the Tasaday _ . The people were living in nearby huts and they were all _ jeans and T-shirts, not leaves. He thought that perhaps they were not an ethnic minority at all . When he _ to Switzerland, Mr. Iten wrote about the Tasaday people in the newspapers. He said he thought that they were just ordinary farmers, poor, but not _ from anyone else. He believed that in 1971, the government told \"the Tasaday\" to _ they were native people from thousands of years ago, so that tourists---and money---would start _ into the region. One group of experts said that they really were people who had no _ with modern life before 1971; another group said they were just _ the part. So who are these people, really?
