{"article": "\"The way we choose to respond when others make mistakes can cause them to feel ashamed or can allow them to remember our kindness and share our stories with future generations.\" ----Michelle Sedas When I read the above quote I couldn't help but think of Doris.She had been a science teacher by _ ,but she also was a very _ person.All around her room were dolls that she had made.They were the most interesting dolls I'd ever seen;each was very _ from the other. By talking to Doris I learned she'd _ a class in doll making.One day while I was in her room she took one of the dolls out of the case to _ me.This doll was very _ with fine artistic work.I was _ that anyone could do such unique work. As Doris was _ the doll carefully in her hand,I could see a slight break in the skirt.I was _ to know what happened.Doris said that on the way to class she _ the side of the skirt.She expressed how scared she was and almost didn't go to _ at a11.When it came her _ to show the doll to the teacher,she had to point out the _ in the skirt.Doris felt for sure that the doll would be _ because of it.Much to her surprise the teacher told her she was just going to _ this break and grade the doll on the other good _ it had.Doris shared that this remark and _ from the teacher changed her life. This teacher could have made Doris feel _ by her mistake.But because of her willingness to ignore the mistake,Doris was sharing her kindness with the next generation.", "options": [["profession", "accident", "birth", "mistake"], ["energetic", "generous", "creative", "conservative"], ["far", "safe", "free", "different"], ["taken", "quitted", "prepared", "organized"], ["flatter", "show", "comfort", "upset"], ["common", "cheap", "expensive", "unusual"], ["disappointed", "amazed", "terrified", "annoyed"], ["turning", "bending", "mending", "shaking"], ["sorry", "proud", "curious", "content"], ["burned", "bumped", "replaced", "decorated"], ["hospital", "church", "class", "work"], ["turn", "task", "honor", "choice"], ["spot", "patch", "hole", "break"], ["destroyed", "appreciated", "rejected", "removed"], ["ignore", "value", "notice", "assess"], ["talents", "quantities", "varieties", "qualities"], ["responsibility", "attitude", "habit", "standard"], ["ashamed", "shocked", "puzzled", "overjoyed"]], "answers": ["A", "C", "D", "A", "B", "D", "B", "A", "C", "B", "C", "A", "D", "C", "A", "D", "B", "A"]}
